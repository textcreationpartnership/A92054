            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My portion to diſpenſe the Word of God is fallen out in a very diſheartning and in an evill time: yet let the oppoſition of the world, of fleſh, and of the devil; let the carnall reaſonings of fleſh and blood, let the malice of unreaſonable men be never ſo great, I have determined with my ſelf to be the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Church, ſo long as my life, health, ſtrength, liberty, or any ability

<pb facs="tcp:115586:6"/>though yet there is not a ſufficient purgation of pride, ſelf ſeeking and of the advancement of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before the everlaſting wiſdom of God, from the Midſt of them. And there is yet ſomething to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bleſſing of God will deſcend upon them in ſuch a plentifull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as otherwiſe it would, to wit, a joynt ſetting themſelves with one ſhoulder, and with one conſent to ſerve God in ſincerity of heart, and to beſtir themſelves more then ever for the preſerving of the truth of God, and to cleare the truth from all thoſe calumnies which have been caſt upon it in theſe latter times, and to ſtand up for the honour of God, and of his Church. Now as there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, men of perverſe minds, reprobate concerning the faith, given over to a ſpirit of deluſions, blinded with a judiciall blindneſs, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a judiciall hardneſs, led away with the vanity of their minds,

As <hi>Mahomet</hi> the vileſt of men did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that he was inſpired by the holy Ghoſt in the form of a Dove. ſo theſe miſerable creatures pretend to the teachings of the ſpirit upon their hearts, that ſo their hereticall and blaſphemous Tenents may receive the better entertainment. If they had not fathered their falſhoods, blaſphemies, hereſies upon the Spirit of God, I had ſlept in ſilence, but when they make the Spirit of God to be a lying ſpirit, a deluding ſpirit, a profane ſpirit, by their ſaying that the Spirit teacheth them to live above Ordinances, to
<pb facs="tcp:115586:7"/>blaſpheme, to ſcoffe at the word of his grace, that the Spirit will ſupply all their wants without the uſe of means, and that they ſtand not in need of thoſe beggarly Elements, to wit, the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, and other means of grace, as they call them, and all upon the account of the Spirits teaching: I had no reſt in my ſpirit, till what light was imparted unto me concerning the teaching of the ſpirit upon the hearts of believers, I had publiſhed for the benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of true honeſthearted Chriſtians; expecting to undergoe the cenſure of ſome <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> or other, though God who trieth all things knoweth the ſincerity of my heart in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I wiſh the ſubject of my diſcourſe had had a better workman to have handled it; but what is defective in my endeavours ſhal be ſupplied in my prayes, that God would poure forth of his Spirit more and more upon the hearts of his people, according to the

This admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition includes two things, as 1 A demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the abſurdity of the things which they hold.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecret inſinuating unto them the truth and the excellency of the oppoſite to which they hold.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The beſt and the moſt precious doctrine that is meeting with an unſanctified heart is oppoſed, and had in deriſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That is the beſt preaching which works upon the affections ſtirring us up to our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titual duty that we may ſerve God acceptably, in reverence and godly fear, all the daies of our life, as well as informs our judgements.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Embaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Goſpel of his grace, muſt be men of peace, and not ſtudy to make factions and parties in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 For believers to call themſelves by the names of their ſpiritual guides be they never ſo holy and religious men, or by ſtrange names taken up by the contumelies of ungodly men,
<pb facs="tcp:115586:14"/>is an unchriſtian thing, and diſagreeing to the minde of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The word of God conſidered abſolutely in it ſelf, as the word of God ought to be the rule and ground of our faith.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For men to preach their own inventions and new fangled notions, and the fancies of their own intoxicated braines; or for men to allegorize Scriptures according as their mind ſerves them, neglecting the pure fountain of the word of God, is to build mans faith upon humane wiſedome, and not upon the power of God.</p>
            <p n="8">8 A ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt muſt ſute his ſtyle and matter according to the judgement and capacity of his hearers.</p>

               <hi>I beguiled you, i. e.</hi> I caught you as fiſhes are caught in a net, before you were aware, by the power of the Word upon your hearts. We ought to ſtrike the iron while it is hot, and to work upon mens hearts when they are ſtirred up by a holy compunction of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to ſearch into the nature of things. Every time is not fit to deal with men for their ſouls good, becauſe the ſpirits of men, according to mens various aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſtirred up at ſuch a time, rather then another, are more ſutable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an impreſſion than at another time, as the ſtories of <hi>Amaziah</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115586:21"/>will clearly ſhew, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. We read of <hi>Amaziah</hi> that having hired an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand valiant men out of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt the children of <hi>Seir;</hi> the Propher came to him in the Name of the Lord, commanding him to ſeparate theſe men from the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> that they might return to their own place. Here <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> readily obeyed the Word of the Lord by the Prophet, though to his own damage, with the loſs of the hundred Talents of ſilver. Yet we finde in the following verſes of the ſame Chapter, that the ſame King <hi>Amaziah,</hi> when the Prophet came to reprove him for ſerving the Gods of the Nations whom he had overcome, he was wrath with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and diſobeyed the Word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>O what a happy iſſue might many of Gods people have had of their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reproofs upon the ſouls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they had done it when the ſoul was of a tender frame of ſpirit, ſenſible of its own infirmity, and under the ſenſe of its inſufficiency kept low in its own eyes, deſiring above all things to be taught by the Spirit.

There is no great Monarch can leſs endure a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſtanding in his preſence in nothing but ragges and full of bruiſes and ſores and running iſſues from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot, from whence comes moſt noyſom ſmels, than God can endure a proud vaunting finner ſtanding before him in his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.6.</note> for ail our righteouſneſs is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes,

Verſe</hi> 41. the hard-hearted Jews they murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am that bread which came down from heaven. The Jews who had as yet the vail upon their hearts, and whoſe minds by their own wilfulneſs and diſobedience Satan had blinded leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſhine in their hearts, had no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of bread,<note place="margin">When Manna which was the type of Chriſt came down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, there was old won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at it; and it was called Manna, becauſe they ſaid by way of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ma-hu,</hi> What is this? And they were very gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a time after it. But when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the true Bread, the true Manna came down from heaven to feed our ſouls, there was no minding of him, becauſe his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity was over-vaild in his humanity, they did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at Gods goodneſs as they ought to have done: they rejected him. He came to his own, and his own received him not. Indeed they made him the laughing-ſtock of the world. And ſo Chriſt may be ſaid to be the wonder of the world, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiab</hi> ſaith, I and my children are ſet for ſignes and wonders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.18. <hi>i. c.</hi> We are made the maygames of the world, at whom all do deride and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But they did not admire his excellency, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, and ſeek to him, as it behoved them to have done.</note> but as it fed the belly. But Chriſt Jeſus hath a higher myſtery in it, to wit, that he was the true Manna, the true heavenly Bread that feedeth their ſouls unto everlaſting life. In the ſucceeding verſes, 48, 49, 50, 51. when Chriſt proceeds in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf to be the Bread of Life, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115586:28"/>his fleſh is meat indeed and his blood is drink indeed. <hi>Verſe</hi> 52. the Jews ſtrove amongſt themſelves ſaying, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to cat?</hi> In the 60 <hi>Verſe</hi> many of his Diſciples when they heard this, ſaid, This is a hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who can hear it. <hi>Verſe</hi> 66. From that time many of his Diſciples went back and walked no more with him. Hence you ſee what carnall reaſonings, and ſinfull objections mens hearts do frame and invent to hinder and oppoſe the comfort of the ſweeteſt and moſt comfortable Doctrine. What more ſweet to a hungry ſoul that longs after eternall life, than to be fed and to be nouriſhed with this Bread of Life? It
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115586:28"/>is an infallible ſign that you are born of God,<note place="margin">☜</note> and that your originall is from above, and that God is your Father, Chriſt is your Brother, and that you have higher principles than the fleſh and the world to walk by, and that your life is hid with Chriſt in God, if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the true Bread of Life doth nouriſh up your ſouls unto eternall Life: For the <hi>axiom</hi> holds true in ſpirituall things as well as naturall, <hi>A quo aliquid genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ab eodem nutritur,</hi> from the which any thing is begotten, of the ſame it is nouriſhed; if you are born of God, you will be nouriſhed by the bread of God; if your originall be heavenly, your food will be heavenly; if God were your Father, Chriſt would be your nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and your food. Therefore Chriſt tels the Jews, who in the eighth of <hi>John verſ.</hi> 41. boaſted that God was their Father, <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. proved them not to be the children of God, and that God was not their Father, becauſe they did not love him who was ſent of God the Father, If God were your Father, then would you <hi>love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.1.</note> He that loves him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115586:29"/>that begets, loves him alſo who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and if we did love God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhould love Jeſus Chriſt the only begotten Sonne of the Father, and the Saints who are the ſpirituall ſonnes of God, begotten of the Spirit, crying in their hearts Abba Father. In the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> he proves them poſitively to be the children of the devil, becauſe they ſerve him and do his works. Chriſt turns all carnall things into ſpirituall uſes, and changes the nature of them, and like a true Alchymiſt, turneth braſs into Gold; but the Jews on the other ſide turned Gold into braſs, and of all thoſe pretious ſpirituall truths which Chriſt had delivered unto them, they had baſe carnall and low apprehenſions of. Bleſſed are they that by a lively faith feed heartily upon the ſpirituall Manna, while others feed upon the husks with the ſwine, they have bread in their fathers houſe.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115586:30"/>ſtirre up what affections he pleaſeth in the hearts of his people, as it is reported of excellent <hi>Bucholcer,</hi> that though he were two hours in his Sermon, yet none of the common people were aweary of him; and that with ſuch vehemency of ſpirit, and earneſt longing for the good of their ſouls he diſpenſed the Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that he could ſtirre up what affection he pleaſed in the hearts of his hearers. Neither was the matter he preacht ſo ſublime as to make men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him and to cry him up: Not Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall notions, or criticall points of Divinity, or curious queſtions, or needleſs Doctrines, but the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and him crucified; For I have determined not to know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.

What a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged foppery of humane inventions and mans traditions is the Popiſh Religion? What abundance of forms and outward worſhips have they? as if God did look more at the outward man, and externall behaviour, than at the hidden man of the heart, the ſincerity of our actions, and the purity of our intentions; the Lord judgeth not according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.7.</note> but he judgeth righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

This foundation will melt as the wax before
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115586:45"/>the Sun, in the time of Gods pleading and contending with ſinners. Others are too extream on the other hand, and care not for any decency and order in reſpect of outward worſhip, and cry down all outward circumſtances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, becauſe God chiefly regards the heart. Let ſuch know, that God is the God of our bodies, as well as of our ſouls, and he requireth outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that we ſhould bow before him, and fall down at his preſence, and teſtifie the brokenneſs and contrition of heart by outward geſtures, as well as heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, though that be the principall he aims at.

Chriſt deals with his Church as a loving friend doth with his friend: You know when friends are going a long journey, or a dangerous voyage by ſea, they uſe to leave behind them with their deareſt friends ſome pledge or token of their love. Some leave their pictures, ſome a ring, ſome a good book, ſome one thing, ſome another, with this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, When you look on this, remember me, and though you ſhould ſee me no more, yet be not troubled, here is a pledge of my love which I have left with you, keep it, be ſure you keep it, and do not part with it.

Though Chriſt hath promiſed to give the Spirit to thoſe that pray, yet not for their prayers. We are to pray for the Spirit, becauſe God hath commanded it, but not to expect it for our prayers, becauſe God hath promiſed it. The Spirit of God comes by receiving, therefore whoſoever thou art that thinkeſt, by thy endeavours to have the Spirit, though I will not curſe thee as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> for thinking to purchaſe the holy Ghoſt with money, though he had but ſuch a thought in's heart; yet I tell thee thou ſhalt never have it.

The devil is the ſpirit of the world upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: 1. He acts in the world, and quickens and puts vigour, and brings
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115586:62"/>forth into act, that originall corruption that lies rooted in the heart of all men by nature. The work of the Spirit it is to give life, and heat, and motion, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and refreſh, to excite the parts to do their office. Now as the Spirit of God moved upon the waters in the firſt Creation, hovering over the Moſaicall matter, fomenting and cheriſhing it, ſo the evil ſpirit the devil moves upon the filthy puddles in our hearts, hovering over that filthy corruption which is in us, cheriſhing and fomenting that body of death which we carry aboot us. As the Vulture loves to feed upon dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes, ſo the devil loves to rake up that ſtinking cartion matter which is in the hearts of all men by nature. Now the devil is not only an aſſiſtant ſpirit to the world that ſees the wheels a going (as the aſſiſting Angels are,<note place="margin">☞</note> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſuppoſeth to ſet the <hi>primum mobile</hi> a work) but he worketh with us, and he worketh in the world. Sometimes our hearts like a mint out of that abundance of corruption that is in them, may coin evil things, for ſinne in the heart will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the life; obſcene and filthy words do naturally flow from a luſtfull
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115586:62"/>heart: But yet the coin often carries upon it the devils ſtamp;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of the ſcorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is not one minute, wherein it puts not forth the ſting, as being loth to loſe any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: ſo Satan will loſe no fit time to tempt us, to draw us to his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us. <hi>Burrought Moſes</hi> choice:</note> if he ſees us inventing miſchief, he will be ſure to put to his helping hand. Many times the devil is the father of evil thoughts, but our own hearts are the mother, the devil ſuggeſteth, but it's our own hearts that conceive, according to the Pſal. miſt. They conceive miſchief and bring forth falſhood. It is the devil that blows up the fire of luſt in our hearts, and adds fuell to it by his delicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. That makes men ruſh into ſinne, as the horſe ruſheth into the battell. As we commonly ſay, he muſt needs runne whom the devil drives. Satan did but put it into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart to betray his Maſter, and preſently he ſets about his buſineſs. As ſoon as the devil had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into him, he runs headlong to the deſtruction of his immortall ſoul. When a man hath winde and tide, and the ſails be up, he muſt needs go apace. Our affections are the ſails, our carnall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and ſelf-ſeeking is the tide, and the devil is the winde. If our ſails are up,<note place="margin">☜</note> and the tide favours us, the ſtream of the times, or our <hi>Dallilah</hi> luſts do proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the devil comes and addes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115586:63"/>winde to the tide, and flatters us in our waies by promiſing us the ſame gales of proſperity ſtill, we fail apace and in abundance of delight for a time, till at length we fall down into the <hi>Mare mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> into the dead ſea of everlaſting miſery. Think upon this, who with a full career ſwim down with the current of the times, and care not whither you are carried, ſo be it your carnall intereſt may proſper, and that you may have the favour of a flattering world. You are acted by the devil, and certainly at death he will pay you your wages. He is that filthy, unclean, Idolatrous ſpirit that keeps the world in their ſuperſtitious waies, and which to this day beguiles the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and holds the greateſt part of the world in Idolatry, and Heatheniſh impiety, to the great diſhonour of the true God, and to their own everlaſting condemnation. 2. He is the ſpirit of the world, becauſe he not only acts the world, but alſo becauſe the world willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffers it ſelf to be acted by him. Wicked men are ſaid to be led captive by him at his will.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> He leads them in a ſtring to eternall perdition. As a Falconer carries his Hawk upon his fiſt, ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115586:63"/>carries poor creatures. They do not take up arms to fight againſt him,<note place="margin">Wicked men moſt properly are ſaid to act evil.

I may ſay the world is a ſworn enemy to Jeſus Chriſt, and a faithfull drudge to do the devils drudgery. As Chriſt admits none but voluntiers, and ſuffers none to be of his ſociety, but they that willingly ſubmit themſelves to his diſcipline: ſo the devil hath a great army of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and they willingly accept of his tearms and conditions: This only is the difference, the godly do take Jeſus Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour directly, and as they ſerve Jeſus Chriſt who is the great Maſter, ſo they love him and embrace him for their Head and Governour; but now the wicked world doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly take the devil to be their Lord and Maſter, for the thought of a devil is odious in the hearts of all, both good and bad, and none would be ſaid to be

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115586:66"/>and make it of no effect.

And as it is reported he hath feigned voices in the air, commanding that ſuch a Saint departed ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. As <hi>Romulus</hi> after he was dead appeared again (or the devil in the ſhape of <hi>Romulus</hi>) commanding that he ſhould be worſhipped for a God under the name <hi>Quirinus.</hi> And therefore that was the devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.14.</note> and not <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf, becauſe he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Saul</hi> to worſhip him. The devil is Antichriſt alſo, becauſe he oppoſeth Chriſt. Chriſt had two eminent conflicts with him, one in the wilderneſs, where the devil was in preſence with him, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting him to have unbeſeeming thoughts of God the Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>If you be the Sonne of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if God were your Father, he would not let you be in ſo great ſtraits as to want bread.

God the Father will work a miracle, before he will ſee his childe to want. This the devil did to take away his minde from the love of God his Father, and to drive him from his faith and confidence in God. Beſides, it had been a ſinne in Chriſt, if he had obeyed the devil.

The unregenerate part the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fleſh is called a ſpirit: ſaith <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 4.5.</note> The ſpirit within us luſteth to envy, <hi>i.e.</hi> that fleſhly part within us is full of envy. Luſteth to envy, the ſame word which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115586:68"/>is in the fore-mentioned place, the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the ſame action that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the fleſh, is applied to the Spirit, the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, <hi>i.e.</hi> luſteth againſt the Spirit. Now if the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is applied to both the principles, to fleſh and Spirit, to wit, luſteth (which action is a proper action of ſpirits) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the unregenerate part is a ſpirit. And if the unregenerate, much more the regenerate. But you will ſay it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to call the fleſh a ſpirit. Indeed to ſay naturall fleſh were a ſpirit, it were a contradiction in the very terms, but to ſay fleſh, <hi>i.e.</hi> corrupt fleſh, is a ſpirit, is no contradiction, but an abuſe of the word. But you will ſay, <hi>Analogum per ſe poſitum ſtat pro famoſiore ſignificatu,</hi> therefore ſeeing fleſh is put alone by it ſelf, it muſt not be meant of corrupt and ſinfull fleſh, but of naturall fleſh. To this I anſwer, That the unregenerate part is not <hi>Analogically</hi> but <hi>Aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> called fleſh.

Indeed Gods people may be ſorely ſmut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and beſmeared with the fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as we ſee by experieuce that fire commonly blacks things before it makes them clear) but yet they ſhall not be conſumed, as the wicked ſhall be, but ſhall be delivered.<note place="margin">Pſ. 34 17.</note> The Lord knoweth how to deliver the righteous out of all their afflictions.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115586:77"/>for theſe reaſons: 1. Fire puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, it ſeparates the droſs from the pure metall: ſo afflictions they purifie the ſoul. Gods children are afflicted, that they might be made partakers of his holineſs.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.10.</note> Before affliction came upon us, we were unclean, we were worldly, earthly minded, we forgot our God, we were impure, inſtruments fit only for the devils ſervice. But by afflictions we are cleanſed, we are more ſpirituall, and have learnt to minde heavenly things, more watchfull, more induſtrious to pump out ſinne as faſt as it comes into the ſoul, and to be more diligent in Gods ſervice; afflictions are Gods files, whereby he takes away that ruſt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the ſoul. How many hath a fit of ſickneſs, an outward croſs in their eſtates, relations, good names, the miſſing of their expectations, the unfaithfulneſs of friends, the deceit that is in the world, or ſome grief which hath been as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dropping upon their ſouls, as the Stone, Wind-cholick, Falling ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> driven home from the houſe of their ſpirituall bondage, and from this myſticall <hi>Egypt,</hi> where there is nothing but pollution, to bethink themſelves of

                  <hi>I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now have I learned thy righteous judgements.</hi> Affliction it is Gods pruning knife, whereby he lops off the ſuperfluous branches; it is Gods Razor, whereby he ſhaves off the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies of ſinne; it is Gods niter, whereby he cleanſeth our defiled gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p n="2">2. Fire melts ſome things and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes others: Afflictions melt the heart of Gods people, but they conſume the ungodly. <hi>Joſias</hi> heart melted when he heard the Law of the Lord read,<note place="margin">2 King. 22.19.</note> though he did but hear what threatnings God
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115586:78"/>had made againſt the breach of his Law, his heart melted within him. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> heart melted under Gods offliction. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of ſpirit comes often from poverty of purſe in a childe of God. But the afflictions of the wicked they do but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyl them for hell, they are but heralds of everlaſting vengeance, Gods pledges that he will never do them good, they do but eat out their ſpirits, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, their common graces, againſt the eternall conſumption of their ſpirits, by that ever gnawing worm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fire it ſoftens ſome things, and it hardens others: So afflictions they ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the godly, but harden the wicked; the more God afflicted <hi>Ahaz.</hi> the more he ſinned, and the more his heart was hardened, therefore God hath put this brand of infamy upon him never to be wiped off again,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 28.22.</note> 
                  <hi>This is that King Ahaz.</hi> So <hi>Pharachs</hi> heart was hardened by Gods judgements. It is a moſt dreadfull ſign God intends to make thee a brand of hell fire, if thy heart is hardened under the afflicting hand of God.<note place="margin">How affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be ſaid to harden.</note> Fire it ſoftens the wax, but hardens the clay; afflictions do not harden as conſidered abſolutely in themſelves, but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115586:78"/>as they meet with the corruptions of mens wicked hearts. A wicked man is like the Smiths Anvill, the more he is ſmitten, the more rebellious and ſtout hearted he is.<note place="margin">☜</note> Affliction it is ſo farre from driving a wicked man to God, that it drives him farther from him, making him deſperate in his wicked courſes, and like <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, when the dart of Gods vengeance hath been upon them, they have blaſphemed and curſed the holy Name of God. It is a moſt dreadfull thing, and a great aggravation of our condemnation, when we adde ſinne to ſinne under the afflicting hand of God: As in <hi>Ames</hi> 4. ſaies the Lord, I have brought ſuch and ſuch judgements upon you, yet have you not returned unto me ſaith the Lord. But Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are of another diſpoſition, of a flexible and of a pliable nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive whatſoever God ſhall impart unto them; they conſider that God is their Father, and that all their afflictions ſhall be for their good. That God corrects them but in meaſure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Enaſhim,</hi> of a weak, ſickly, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy man.</note> and with the rods of a man, and that it is either to make them humble for their ſinnes, or to prevent the breaking forth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115586:79"/>of the boyls of ſin for the future. They know that God looks more to the frame of their hearts, and how their ſpirits are under Gods hand, whether perverſe and peeviſh, or patient and ſubmiſſive, than at any thing elſe. Beſides, they conſider that theſe afflictions are but to drive them to their Fathers houſe, and when they are ſufficiently broken, and ſufficiently humbled under his afflicting hand, he will take them up in his arms and kiſs them (as a loving mother doth a weak ſickly childe) and reſtore unto them the joy of his ſalvation. There are two extreams we are apt to runne into under afflictions, either to deſpiſe the chaſtning of the Lord,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.5.</note> or to faint under his diſpleaſure: Wicked men they deſpiſe the hand of God, and Chriſtians are ready often to faint, but that Jeſus Chriſt ſtands by, as he did by that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martyr, and wipes the ſweat off from their faces, when they are nigh to ſwound, and gives them ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſun-ſhines of his loving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>X. The Spirit is taken for the motions of the Spirit upon our hearts: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. Quench not the Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> the

Have a care of this great ſinne, leſt by thy impenitency, ingratitude, and willfull rebellion thou ſtifleſt the glowings of the Spirit. Have a care that when God ſtrives with thee thou doeſt not ſtrive with God again. It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.<note place="margin">Act. 9.5.</note> Have a care thou beeft not found a fighter againſt God. Saith <hi>Stephen</hi> of the rebellious Jews, Ye ſtiff-necked,<note place="margin">Act. 7.51.</note> ye do alwaies reſiſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> you turn the deaf adder, you ſtop your ears againſt the bleſſed Spirit warning you of that deſtruction which you have brought upon your ſelves in betraying the Lord of life. Wicked men when they quench the Spirit are ſaid to provoke the Spirit. They ſtirre up a holy anger and revenge in the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſins.<note place="margin">Mark 3.5.</note> As Jeſus Chriſt looked upon the Phariſees with a holy anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts, ſo the Spirit is angry at the hardneſs of the hearts of ſtubborn heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115586:80"/>ſinners.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note> But you who are the people of God, you grieve the Spirit of God by your unkindneſs, when ye ſeek to put out the light of the Spirit within you. Walk in the light while you have the light, for though God will never leave you wholly in the dark, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of his Spirit, yet he may bring a cloud of temptation over you, which may eclipſe the glory of it for a time. I beſeech you grieve not the Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption. As you would not be ſaid to kick againſt the bowels of a bleeding Saviour by your ſinnes, ſo neither do you kick againſt the bowels of a moſt gracious Spirit, or of the Spirit of grace ſtriving with your hearts to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the truth. As wicked men by their often ſinning againſt the Spirit, do quite ſinne away the Spirit (for by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo often againſt conviction, they ſinne ſo long till they have no light to ſinne again, having ſinned it all away) ſo the godly by ſinning againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do cauſe it to withdraw its gracious influences for the preſent. O that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſciences mourning under the loſs of the comfortable preſence of God
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115586:80"/>in Jeſus Chriſt, would conſider this; Thou that complaineſt of the Spirits ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Haſt thou not ſinned away the Spirit by quenching its motions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting its impreſſions? Thou that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt of the want of aſſurance, and of the Spirits not witneſſing with thy Spirit, Haſt thou not ſinned away thy aſſurance by committing ſome ſinne, or omitting ſome duty againſt the light of the Spirit? What a wicked thing is it that Chriſtians ſhould complain of the Spirit, and murmur againſt God for the light of his countenance, when God and his Spirit have more reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of them? Chriſtians are ſaid to quench the Spirit two waies:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they withdraw the fuell which ſhould maintain the Spirit: as fire is put out when you withdraw the fuell which ſhould maintain the fire; ſo you quench the Spirit, when you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the fuell by which the Spirit is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. When you will not hear the Word, when you will not pray, when you neglect the Sacraments (the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often received is a great confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith, and a great cheriſher of the work of the Spirit upon our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115586:81"/>hearts) when you will not be much in meditation (the Spirit loves to meet with a ſolitary ſoul disburdened of the world, and ſeeking to have communion with God) when you will not conferre and often ſpeak of the things of God, when you forſake the aſſembling of the Saints together. As one coal kindles another, and one candle enlightens ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo the light of the Spirit in the heart of another, may in time kindle and flame thy heart.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> When men fail to ſtirre up the gift of God which is in them,<note place="margin">

Chriſtians ſhould be men of activity, alwaies doing and never idle in the work of the Lord. As the fountain is ſtill purging forth that filth which lies nigh it: ſo Chriſtians ſhould be ſtill purging forth the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that originall corruption which is in them; ſtill reſiſting temptations, continually treaſuring up the whole armour of God againſt the fiery triall; daily weaning themſelves from the world, and preparing to meet Jeſus
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115586:81"/>Chriſt the Bridegroom of their ſouls. As an idle man is the devils ſhop, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he forgeth what he pleaſeth, ſo an active Chriſtian is the Spirits ſhop. If we do what we are able, beleeve it Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the Spirit will not be behind hand, but will further the work of grace in our hearts. It is becauſe we are ſo backward in our duty, that the Spirit is ſo backward upon our ſouls. If thou wouldſt have the continuall flowings in of the Spirit, I beſeech thee Chriſtian, for the good and for the comfort of thy ſoul, for I ſpeak what all true Chriſtians do generally finde good, pray more,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.</note> pray continually, that is, loſe no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, let no time paſs when thou oughteſt to pray, or when thy occaſions require it (for there are many emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which fall out, which require this duty, and of ſome Chriſtians more than others) but be ſure to pray, hear the word at all occaſions; let not a Sermon paſs if you can hear it; let not your ſouls be famiſhed for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As you would not be ſaid to murder your bodies, ſo do not you mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your precious ſouls. Many do quench the Spirit when they do not know it. Some
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115586:82"/>will hear a conſciencious Miniſter a long while, and highly commend him, as moſt of our profane <hi>Eſau</hi>'s do, but when once this Miniſter ſhall touch their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſinnes, they preſently fall off and hear him no more.<note place="margin">Mar. 6.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly for a time, and reformed many things, but when once he touched his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and toucht the apple of his eye, he preſently diſtates him, and cuts off his head. What a ſad thing is it, that men ſhould ſhift off ſuch an impreſſion, and wipe off the ſweet and heavenly dew? If you will not wait at the pool, you are never like to have the Spirit deſcend upon you, and if you will not mark the time of the Spirits coming down, and comply with the Spirit at ſuch a time, you are never like to have any feeling ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wrought upon your ſouls: Have a care therefore of withdrawing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits fuell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When men caſt their luſts in the Spirits face, and damp the breathings of the Spirit by their luſts, then they may be ſaid to quench the Spirit. As water quencheth fire, ſo luſts they quench the Spirit. Luſt is the great quench coal of the Spirits motions. As mud and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115586:82"/>filth doth damp up the courſe of the water: ſo every luſt doth dam up the courſe of the Spirit. Yea every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſinne which is committed with a high hand to the reproach of godlineſs, and to the diſhonour of God, quencheth the Spirit for a time.

As luſts choak the Word, ſo they choak the Spirit. Whence is it that many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do complain of the Spirits abſence, and of the departure of God from them, as <hi>Saul</hi> did,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo is me for God is departed from me?</hi> Why?

Search your hearts diligently, and ſee whether there be not ſome abominable thing which the Spirit would pluck forth of thy heart. Is there not a hankering after thy old beloved luſts? Haſt thou not an itching after paſt delights, when thou wert in the fleſh? The Spirit doth not all its work upon a ſoul at the firſt work of converſion, but ſtill afterwards is imployed to purge out every abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing out of thy heart (a child of God after converſion may fall into the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115586:83"/>ſame ſinnes he committed before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, yea the very ſame beloved ſins) the venomous humour is not throughly purged out in converſion, and the Spirit by its good will would not leave a hoof or any root of bitterneſs in the heart, but becauſe we are in the body of this fleſh, we muſt grow by degrees, and make progreſs daily.</p>
               <p>Search I beſeech you and examine your hearts, whether there be not ſome luſt, the Spirit would give a deaths wound to, and throughly mortifie and extinguiſh, and you will not yield to the Spirit that you may be mortified.

It will never come with its comforting preſence, till thou cloſeſt with the Spirit in this great work. Examine your hearts, I beleeve
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115586:84"/>if the buſineſs were throughly fifted, there is ſome luſt at the bottom, ſome filth that lies below which keeps out the Spirit from coming into thy heart.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sic ut fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus apes, &amp; fater columbot, ſic Spiritum ſanctum expellit grave oleus peccatum.

Yea, I ſay, the Spirit cannot come into thy heart, while thy luſt ſtandeth out againſt him. There is an oppoſition in reſpect of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; What communion hath light with darkneſs, God with Belial, the pure Spirit with thy filthy luſt? The Spirit may come and knock long enough, and Chriſt may knock long enough, and to no purpoſe, if thou art not willing that the Spirit ſhould accompliſh the work upon thy heart. I beſeech you examine your hearts in this matter.<note place="margin">Note this well.</note> A man may live a Profeſſor all his daies, and be as conſcientious in the waies of God,<note place="margin">☞</note> as any Chriſtian in the world, and think himſelf as fair for heaven as the beſt, and yet at laſt periſh for ſome unknown luſt in his heart, which if he had examined and found out, it might have been mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,

The Spirit will not blow upon thy heart when thou wouldeſt have it, but when it lifteth. The Spirit comes down but upon certain times, and thoſe times are uncertain to thee; how there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth it behoove thee, Chriſtian, to take the Spirits time, and to joyn with the work of the Spirit upon thee? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, doſt thou know how long the Spirit will move upon thy heart; how long the proſperous gales will laft, which if thou hadſt ſailed along with, would have brought thee to heaven? Doſt thou know how long the Spirit will ſtrive with thy heart, crying out, Why ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how long ſhall it be ere Chriſt ſhall be thy Lord and Saviour? Beloved Chriſtian, though there be hope as long as the pool is open, and thou art alive, and liveſt under the Ordinances of grace, that the Spirit may deſcend again upon thee, yet ſeeing thou haſt ſinned ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the pleadings of the Spirit, and haſt quenched the Spirit ſo long, who can tell whether ever he will come down in mercy again upon thy ſoul for

Though this time God hath reſerved in his own wiſdom ſecret from men that they ſhould not know it. The black book of reprobation is known only to God, and none may ſay poſitively God hath rejected him, unleſs he is certain he hath ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt (as too many weak Chriſtians under deſertion are apt to ſay) and how know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou, thou haſt ſinned the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt? if thou haſt a deſire to repent for thy ſinnes, if thou art willing to receive Jeſus Chriſt for thy Lord and Saviour, never fear it Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, all is well, thou art in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: yet I beſeech thee do not quench the motions of the Spirit upon thy heart.</p>
               <p>XI. The Spirit is put for a ſtate or a condition, or a calling, as ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret. We have not received the ſpirit of bondage;<note place="margin">Rom.

It is not ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to men of your profeſſion, of your coat to be ſo fiery and ſo impatient: ſo <hi>Aretius.</hi> Yet I rather follow the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a judicious Divine in our daies, who in the forementioned place in the <hi>Romans,</hi> means by ſpirit, not a ſtate there, but a perſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the bleſſed Trinity, very judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly explaining the words after this manner; Shewing that when once the Spirit hath been the Spirit of adoption, that Spirit is never after the ſpirit of bondage again unto us; this in no waies hindering, but that a childe of God after the Spirit of adoption, may have the fears of bondage again, for though the Spirit doth not contradict his teſtunony, yet he may withdraw his reſt mony for a time, and leave us in the dark, yea the devil may trouble and affright us, and our own conſciences may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>More particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Angels are called ſpirits:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115586:87"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Good: <hi>Who maketh his Angels ſpirits, and his Miniſters a flame of fire, Heb.</hi> 1.</item>
                     <item>2. Evil: <hi>Mark</hi> 5.4. We reade of a man poſſeſſed with an unclean ſpirit, and ſaith Chriſt, What is thy name? ſaith the unclean ſpirit again, <hi>My name is Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for we are many.</hi> A Legion of devils in one poor man.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By way of eminency God is called a Spirit: <hi>John</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> God is a Spirit, if you take God eſſentially for the Deity,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, More particularly the third Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Father and the Sonne, is called a Spirit. Often times in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture he is called by the Name of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. <hi>I ſaw the holy Ghoſt deſcend upon him like a Dove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having done with the ambiguity of the word Spirit, I come to ſhew what are the teachings of the Spirit upon the hearts of Beleevers.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:115586:87"/>
               <p>In handling of this I ſhall premiſe, That it is a very difficult thing to know what the teachings of the Spirit are. As thou canſt not tell how the bones grow in her that is with child, or what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be the influences of the ſtarres,<note place="margin">Eccl. 11.5.</note> or how-one ſpirit communicates its minde to another, or the cauſes of naturall ſympathy or antipathy, as thou canſt not tell whence the winde cometh,<note place="margin">John 3.</note> or whither it goeth, ſo is every one that is born after the Spirit.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It is a very difficult thing to tell what the Spirits teachings are.</head>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are teachings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from ſenſe. And as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſaies, by how much things are abſtracted from ſenſe, the higher they are, and the more difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. By how much things are more ſpirituall, by ſo much the more hard it is to have a ſpecies or an apprehenſion of them. We can conceive of things but under groſs and materiall apprehenſions, becauſe the Phantaſm which is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the active intellect to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive is materiall. That they be abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115586:88"/>teachings appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are immediatly upon the ſoul, and not barely upon the ſoul, but upon the inmoſt parts of the ſoul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. I will write my Law in their inward parts, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the moſt retired part of the ſoul I will write my Law. So likewiſe the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye renewed in the ſpirit of your minde.</hi> Not only in your minde, but in the ſpirit of your minde. What is meant by the ſpirit of the minde? <hi>i. e.</hi> in the inmoſt and moſt ſpirituall part of your minde. Grace hath its foundation laid deep in the ſoul by the Spirit of God (now you know that is the beſt foundation which is laid the deepeſt) the Spirit ſearcheth into the bottom of the ſoul, and laies the ſeeds of grace as deep rooted as he can. As God when he wrote the Law,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.15.</note> he wrote it upon the two Tables of ſtone, he wrote within and without upon the Tables, noting thereby that there was no place left for man to adde any thing to the perfect Law of God: So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit writes within and without upon the ſoul. The Spirit in converſion ploughs up the fallow ground of our hearts, and ſows the ſeeds of grace within us, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115586:88"/>becauſe of the deepneſs of the ſoil, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at firſt diſcerned by us, but when the ſeed begins to grow up, then we ſee evidently what the Spirit hath been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.7.</note> What I am doing thou doſt not know as yet, but thou ſhalt underſtand hereafter, ſo thou maieſt not know for the preſent what the Spirit means when it teacheth thee. The Spirits foundation is in the dark, but when he comes to rear the building (for beleevers are a ſpirituall houſe of the Spirits own building) and to beautifie the work,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5.</note> and to raiſe it higher and higher, then thou ſhalt ſee the teachings of the Spirit. The firſt leſſons of the Spirit may be ſomewhat myſterious, but when the Spirit ſhall comment upon them, then nothing will be more plain unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are ſpirituall teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and therefore abſtracted teachings. They are ſpirituall teachings, becauſe the Spirit teacheth them. A ſpirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate it ſelf to our ſpirit, no otherwiſe then a ſpirit can. Now as it is a very difficult thing, and much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted with the Schoolmen, to know how the Angels impart their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115586:89"/>and expreſs their mindes one to another, whether <hi>intuitivè</hi> by viewing one another, or by ſomething analog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to ſpeech, which we ſhall know when we come to heaven: So it is as difficult, if not more difficult, to know how the Spirit communicates it ſelf unto our hearts. Satan is ſaid to put evil things into our hearts.<note place="margin">Joh. 13.2.</note> Satan put it into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart to betray his Maſter; but what this putting is we cannot tell. So the Spirit of God is ſaid to put the things of God into our hearts <hi>(I will put my Law into their hearts)</hi> but what this putting is we cannot tell.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirits teachings are very myſterious, becauſe they are ſet forth in Scripture by various ſignificant acts,<note place="margin">John 16.13.</note> as if the teaching of the Spirit was not one numericall act,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.</note> but as it were a complex act, including many particular acts in it.<note place="margin">Col. 2.2. Job 33.31 Rom. 12.2.</note> Sometimes the guiding act, the witneſſing act, the aſſuring act, the inlightning act, the transforming act, the helping act,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> and in a word, the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act is mentioned in Scripture. The Spirits teaching includes many particular acts,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> when it teacheth us to be holy, it makes us holy;<note place="margin">John 14.26.</note> when it teacheth us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115586:89"/>it aſſures; when it teacheth us what juſtification is, it juſtifies; when it teacheth us to pray, it is ſaid to pray along with us. Now multiplicity of acts breeds diſtraction of minde; eſpecially when the ſingle acts of the Spirit are in themſelves myſterious. Who can tell me what the witneſſing act of the Spirit is, whereby he witneſſeth with our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes of God? I am certain none can know what it is, but he that feels the effect of it upon his own ſpirit, and that not at all times, but when he feels the ſpirit witneſſing. Who can tell me what the ſealing act of the Spirit is, that ſeal of the Spirit by which we are ſealed unto the day of redemption? This art is better felt than taught. Who can tell me what the aſſuring act of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, when it begets that plerophory,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.22.</note> that full aſſurance of faith? Saith <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.17.</note> No man knoweth what that white ſtone of abſolution is, but he that hath it. He ſhall have a white ſtone, and a new name, which none ſhall know but him that hath it. The acts of the Spirit are better felt than expreſſed, known only to thoſe that have them, not to others.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:115586:90"/>
               <p>Having done with the premonition, I come now to ſhew what the teachings of the Spirit be. Herein I ſhall obſerve the words of the Covenant made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in Jeſus Chriſt under the Goſpel, whereof one main part is the teachings of beleevers by his Spirit.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <p>Or, It is the Spirits creating a new light within us, by a ſecret way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto us at the firſt, which light in our conſciences enkindled by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, doth in all things correſpond and agree with the light of the word, and addes more clearneſs to it in reſpect of our ſelves, that we might know the things of God.</p>

In that you are manifeſt to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly tables of the heart. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34.

That even as you ſee in a ſeal, when you have put the ſeal upon the wax, and taken it away again, you ſhall ſee it, ſtamp anſwering to ſtamp, character to character, print to print; ſo it is in the hearts of the faithfull, after their hearts are ſoftned, the Spirit of God writes the Law in their hearts.

The teachings of the Spirit do not only put the things of God into our mindes, but ingraff them as naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in our hearts, yea, the Spirit of God ingravens them. As when let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are engraved in marble, ſo the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit engraven the things of God upon our hearts.</p>
               <p>I call them the writings, the engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the things of God upon our hearts, to diſtinguiſh the teachings of the Spirit, from the motions, impreſſions, flaſhes, illuminations of the pirit. Theſe are but light, ſuperficiall, tranſient works, they reach not to the bottom of the ſoul, but they float at the top: Theſe impreſſions are ſuddenly begun, and ſuddenly ended. They are but as a flaſh of lightning, which is no ſooner ſeen but vaniſheth. They are but as the morning cloud, and as the early dew, which ſuddenly paſs away; as the winde preſently ſcatters the clouds, and the ſunne takes away the dew, ſo all theſe common works of the Spirit paſs away, and melt as the dew before the ſunne.

               <p>The Spirits teachings is the Spirits cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating a new light within us, by a ſecret way unknown unto us at the firſt; which light in our conſciences, enkindled by the Spirit, doth in all things correſpond with the light of the word, and addes more clearneſs to it in reſpect of our ſelves, that we may know the things of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A creating a new light within us.] As God in the naturall creation, created light out of darkneſs, ſo it is in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall creation, when the new man, the infant of grace is born in us.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.8.</note> Ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord.

This light wrought by the Spirit it is a creation: for before this light ariſeth, before the ſunne of righteouſneſs ariſeth upon us, we were altogether darkenſs, we were darkneſs it ſelf. And as it is ſaid of the people amongſt whom the light of the Goſpel ſhined,<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.2.</note> that the people that ſate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115586:94"/>in darkneſs, and in the region of the ſhadow of death, ſaw marvellous light; ſo we poor ſouls, before the Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened us, were in utter darkneſs, as in a dungeon, where there is not the leaſt crany to let in any light.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jude</hi> 13. Blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> in utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel phraſe, Extream darkneſs, where there is not the leaſt light, not any light at all</note> We were in a ſpirituall ſenſe, as it were, in the blackneſs of darkneſs, but when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was pleaſed to come into our hearts, he created light out of darkneſs <hi>(Non ex materiâ quaſi componente, ſed quaſi ex termino à quo)</hi> that is, from darkenſs he hath tranſlated us into marvellous light. Yea I may ſay the Spirits ſetting up a light in the new creature, is more than a creation, if I may ſo ſpeak. For it is harder to create a thing out of its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite in the abſtract, out of darkneſs it ſelf to create light, than to create a thing out of nothing: Excellently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Spirit of God ſet down this portion of Scripture, to note unto us the great work of the Spirit in ſetting up a light in the heart of man.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6</note> God who cauſed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs. I may ſay that ſpirituall darkneſs which is upon the hearts of unregenerate men, hath a poſitive entity in it, oppoſing the light of the Spirit for a time. (The
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115586:94"/>light ſhined round about,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.5.</note> but the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comprehended it not.) It is a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full darkneſs, and a wilfull ignorance; but that firſt darkneſs was a <hi>non-ens,</hi> a meer privation, and as ſoon as ever the light ſhined, the darkneſs vaniſhed away. As to make a man that is born blinde to ſee, is a work equivalent to the work of creation, as Chriſt did. So to remove that blindneſs which is upon our mindes, that naturall blindneſs whereby we are as blinde as beetles in the things of God (We have eyes and ſee not) to remove that blindneſs, and to make us ſee, it is a work of creation, and the only work of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A new light.] That is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent light, a more tranſcendent light. More excellent than the light of nature, or the light of conſcience, more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the light of Ordinances, the light of means, the light of naturall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. More excellent than the light of knowledge, or any light what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. The light of the Spirit is the moſt excellent light.

Sic Philoſophi.

Or it is a ſpark of that primitive light left within us ſince the fall, whereby in ſome meaſure we are able to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil, and accordingly to judge and conſure our ſelves. Now
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115586:95"/>becauſe the light of the Spirit, it is a diffuſive light, ſpreading it ſelf over all the powers and faculties of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And not only a diffuſive light, but a perſwaſive, convincing, directive, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable light, which diſpelleth all the darkneſs which is upon the ſoul, ſuch a light which is the life, being, and vigour of the ſpirituall life. For as knowledge is the life, of the naturall ſoul, ſo is the light of the Spirit the life of the ſpirituall ſoul, giving life, heat and motion unto it; The light was the life of men. Now becauſe the light of the Spirit is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added light to that naturall light which is within us, the light of conſcience, which light conſiſts of the practicall part of the underſtanding, and the memory, both concurring together; therefore though the firſt work of the Spirit is to enlighten our underſtandings, yet becauſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, wherein is the ſeat of ſpirituall life, are benummed and dead, and the Spirits teachings, according to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall part of them, which is the greateſt part of them, reach to the conſcience; therefore I place the hearts or conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which in Scripture phraſe are Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymicall, the ſubject of the light of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115586:96"/>Spirit. Correſpond with the Word.] The light of the Spirit, and the light of the Word do not claſh one againſt another, but in all things do agree in reſpect of the ſubject matter, though the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is far the clearer, <hi>ut antea.</hi> By which light of the Spirit we come to know the things of God. Whereupon <hi>David</hi> praies, Give me, O Lord, thy good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which may leade me into the Land of uprightneſs.</p>
               <p>Now I come to ſhew how the Spirit teacheth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By opening the eyes of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and making us to ſee the things of God. A naturall man hath eyes, but they be ſhut, he hath ears, but they be ſtopt. Now the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is to open our eyes and unſtop our ears, that we might hearken to the things of God. We are by nature like the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in the Land of darkneſs, but when the Spirit hath opened our eyes, we are in the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> in the Land of light. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, might give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, through the acknowledging of him; that the eyes of your underſtanding
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115586:96"/>may be enlightened, that ye may know what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious inheritance in the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By taking away that enmity that is in our wils againſt the things of God. We hate the things of God by nature. Now the Spirit ſhews the excellency, the beauty, the luſter, the pleaſantneſs, the profit that is in God. It removes thoſe hard thoughts and evil ſurmiſes in our hearts, concerning God and the waies of his worſhip. It ſhews us that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is profitable for all things, both for the things of this life and of that which is to come.<note place="margin">Pro. 3.17.</note> That <hi>the waies of wiſdom, are waies of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi>

That it is better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a light affliction here, which is but for a moment, than to undergo an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of torment hereafter, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115586:97"/>to loſe an eternall weight of glory; for if thou canſt not endure a ſhort afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, how wilt thou endure the fire of hell?<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> It ſhews us, that <hi>to him that worketh righteouſneſs is peace, honour and life, but tribulation, anguiſh and ſorrow follows every ſoul that doth evil, both to Jew and Gentile.</hi> The Spirit carries us up on the heavenly mount of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhews us the riches of Gods houſe, and the treaſures of the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſaying, all theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt worſhip God in ſincerity and truth. It perſwades us of the evil of ſinne, of the neceſſity we have of Jeſus Chriſt, of the beauties of holineſs, of the wrath of God that hangs over ſinners, and that there is nothing but the thred of life (which how ſoon it may be cut God knows) which keeps them from burning in everlaſting fire. It ſhews the willingneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt to receive poor repenting ſinners. Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.

What I have heard; ſeen and felt of the word of life, that I ſpeak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</note> and 'tis a certain truth, that a godly poor man, let him be unskilfull in humane Learning, yet if he hath but that <hi>unction of the Spirit</hi> that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, he is able to diſcourſe of the things of God more ſavingly, experimentally and powerſully than the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115586:107"/>greateſt Clerks and Rulers of the world: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Not many mighty, not many wiſe, not many noble are called, but God hath choſen the baſe things of the world to confound the honourable, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.</hi> God did chuſe for his diſciples, not the learned Rabbies of the world, as the Scribes and Phariſees were, but a poor company of Fiſher-men and Tent-makers, delivered this Book unto us. God called <hi>Amos</hi> from following the ſheep, to go and Propheſie to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziab.</hi> And this God did to ſtain the pride of worldly wiſdom, ſhewing, that he ſtood not in need of an arm of fleſh to accompliſh his deſign upon the earth, but that by weak and inconſiderable means in themſelves, he was able to bring about the greateſt deſignes. What is the reaſon that the greateſt Scholars are moſt to ſeek in the things of God, eſpecially in thoſe things which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſalvation? Why, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, they <hi>leaning to their own underſtandings,</hi> and exalting themſelves in the pride of their parts and abillities, do juſtly cauſe God to leave them to themſelves, and in the dark, becauſe they ſeek not after the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115586:107"/>Spirit of God, which is the chief thing to be deſired, if they will know the will of God. We uſually ſay, that he that made the Laws can beſt tell how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them; ſo the Spirit of God which made the Word of God (for holy men of God ſpake as they were inſpired by the Spirit) knows beſt how to explain it. We are to compare ſpirituall things with ſpirituall, and the Spirit of God ſpeaking in one place, with the Spirit ſpeaking in another, if we would know the ſcope and intent of the Word. <hi>No man can ſay Jeſus is the Chriſt, but by the Spirit.</hi> Saith Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he confeſſed him to be the Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-Jona, for fleſh and blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Now the Father, as it is clear from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. declared this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery by the Spirit, <hi>Which in other ages was not made known unto the ſons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy Prophets and Apoſtles by his Spirit.</hi>

               <p>As for practicall duties, 'tis the Spirit only that inflames the heart, enlightens the minde, breeds compunction, and brings ſundry comforts. That teacheth us to deſpiſe earthly things, to leath

That teacheth us that great duty of mortification <hi>(If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the fleſh)</hi> to ſubdue our luſts, to overcome the world, to live a life of faith, and not of ſenſe, to endure afflictions, and to reſiſt temptations.</p>
               <p>The Spirit helpeth us to pray, <hi>We know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by making interceſſions for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> He helpeth together with and over-againſt us:<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. God ſometimes out of his juſtice may permit a childe of God to runne into waies contrary to the truth, becauſe he did not prize the Word of God as he ought to do, and ſeek it with his whole heart, that afterwards being recovered out of the ſnare of the devil, he may more eſteem the Word of God than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115586:111"/>If a Chriſtian who hath lived in <hi>England</hi> under the means of grace, by providence ſhould be caſt among the Heathen, where there is no knowledge of the true God, but idolatry and falſe worſhip ſet up in place of it, how would he eſteem the Ordinances of Chriſt! So when a gracious ſoul ſhall be given up to the deluſions of Satan for a time, and afterwards be recovered, certainly he would let go all, ere he would loſe this pretious jewel of truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> It is ſaid that the unction of the Spirit teacheth them all things; How can they erre therefore?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, that is, there is nothing that belongs to life and ſalvation, but ſome time or other ſhall be revealed to the children of God: The Spirit doth not teach us all the myſteries of God at once, but ſucceſſively, as we are able to receive them: We are not capable to receive all truths at one time. It is with truth, as it is with light, the light grows by degrees, as the ſun aſcends higher and higher in the firmament, ſo the greater is the light,<note place="margin">The Spirit teacheth ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> and the more it is diſperſed. Truth comes not all at once into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but firſt one truth comes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115586:111"/>in, and then another. The Logicians ſay, that upon the receiving one abſurdity a thouſand follow, ſo one truth makes way for another. Therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioniſts of theſe times, who think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay they have the teachings of the Spirit, they know all things, and that they need not have any body to teach them, they are in a groſs miſtake, and as the Apoſtle faith, while they think they know all things, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as they ought to know. Thoſe that are above the Ordinances are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath ſalvation, and thoſe that contemn the ordinary teachings of the Spirit in his Word, and Miniſters, are farre to ſeek in the extraordinary. The Spirit hath babes to nurture, as well as ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it hath ſeveral books to reade, to thoſe that are in the loweſt form in the School of Chriſt, and not ſo high and lofty as to thoſe that are in a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The former he teacheth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the doctrine of God, the later thoſe myſteries which have been kept ſecret from the foundation of the world. The former he deals with in a more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and tender way, to theſe he is more rough and more ſevere. Chriſt hath his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115586:112"/>Lambs, as well as his Sheep, and what doth he do with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd, he ſhall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſom, and gently leade thoſe that are with young.</hi> Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit drives on as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.13. <hi>My Lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me, and if men ſhould drive them over-hard one day, all the flock would die; Let my Lord, I pray thee, paſs over before his ſervant, and I will lead on ſoftly according as the cattell that go before me, and the children are able to bear.</hi> Chriſt leads us as we are able to bear, and the Spirit teacheth us as we are able to learn. The light breaks in upon us by little and little, and Chriſt ſaid unto the Apoſtles, he had many things to ſay unto them, but they could not bear them yet; ſo the Spirit hath many things to teach us, but we are not ſufficiently humbled to receive them.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.2, 3</note> As it is ſaid of Chriſt, ſo it may be ſaid of his Spirit, <hi>He will not break the brniſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax, untill he bring forth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into victory:</hi> that is, he will cheriſh grace and knowledge, though covered
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115586:112"/>over with manifold imperfections, and very ſmall till they ſhall come to that meaſure of perfection which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Doth the Spirit teach ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, though he will teach us all things which pertain to life and godlineſs? What hindereth but that a childe of God may erre in many things, and yet the Spirit of God be ſaid to teach him all things? <hi>v. g.</hi> A Schoolmaſter is ſaid to inſtruct his ſcholar in all the rudiments of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, yet the ſcholar may commit ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes and falſe concordance; and why? becauſe the Maſter doth not teach him all the elements at once, but by degrees. So the Spirit, though it teacheth all things which pertain to life and ſalvation in time; yet becauſe it teacheth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. a childe of God may in the mean time fall into errour, till the Spirit of God ſhall give in a further light into his ſoul, declaring unto him that his tenent is an errour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are inward teachings, that is, they reach to the heart. Many times Miniſters teach, but 'tis not from the heart to the heart, but from the heart to the head. We may inform your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115586:113"/>but we cannot enkindle your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and inflame your hearts with an ardent deſire, and fervent love of the things delivered unto you. The Spirit makes you not only to know the things of God, but in love with the things of God. A ſpirituall man can finde more ſweetneſs in reading one of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> penned by that ſweet Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael Davia,</hi> than in reading all the merry books in the world beſides. Another man may reade the Word of God, but it is only the Spirit that can make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God, according to the inward man. Another man may hear of the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, but it is only the ſpirituall man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems him the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, and deſires him above all things. When the Spirit teacheth the ſoul, let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo dull of apprehenſion, let its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be as cold as a ſtone to heavenly things, let him be as <hi>Epraim,</hi> like a ſilly Dove without a heart, let him be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether averſe from any thing that is good, yet the Spirit ſhall produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heat, life and motion to runne in the waies of God, and not to be weary to go on and not faint. The Spirits
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115586:113"/>teachings will make hearts as hard as rocks to flow forth with rivers of living water, they will cauſe floods to come into the wilderneſs where no water is. It is unexpreſſible what are the kindlings of love, and meltings of heart in a ſoul towards God, that hath once been toucht with this heavenly light of the Spirit from heaven. What is the reaſon we remain ſo dull and ſo cold under ſuch powerfull Ordinances, and ſuch plenteous ſhowrs of grace? Why, I will tell you, you want the inward teachings of the Spirit upon your hearts. In the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you may have light, but you can have no heat, you may have motion, but you can have no zeal. Where the Spirit is, there is light and heat, you will be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining lights.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are evident teachings.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> We reade of the demonſtration of the Spirit; the Spirit when it comes it makes a demonſtration from the effect to the cauſe, becauſe the Spirit worketh in us what it teacheth. The way to faith is by working knowledge in our hearts, and by opening our eyes to ſee in what a caſe we are in by nature, and into what a good condition we are inſtated into by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115586:114"/>Jeſus Chriſt. Knowledge is put for faith, <hi>This is life eternall to know thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou baſt ſent;</hi> that is, to beleeve on thee and Jeſus Chriſt. We may know we are taught by the Spirit, if we live in the Spirit, if we walk in the Spirit, if we warre after the Spirit, and not after the fleſh:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>The weapons of our Warfare are not carnall but ſpirituall, and mighty, to the throwing down of ſinne and Satan.</hi> The Spirits writing upon the heart is in great letters, not in ſmall, ſo that he that runnes may reade it, as it is ſpoken of the viſion in <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> grace is written in legible characters. The Saints of God generally ſtand in their own light,<note place="margin">By <hi>others,</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the world, the wicked world, but the Saints of God. The true Saints are hid to the world. The life of every Saint is hid with Chriſt in God. But one ſpirituall Chriſtian may eaſily diſcern another, becauſe of that likeneſs, which each hath one to another, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity both of them have no Jeſus Chriſt their head.</note> that they cannot ſee thoſe graces in themſelves, which to others are very plain and viſible. True grace loves to lie hid under the vail of humility, the more it ſeeks to hide it ſelf, the more it is diſcovered. The Saints <hi>are the Epiſtle of Chriſt known and read of all men.</hi> The Spirit doth not teach by tipes and figures, and by ſhadows, but it teacheth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115586:114"/>thing, the very ſubſtance. We reade of the manifeſtation of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall. Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. So the Spirit of revelation, <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus, and the Father of glory, might give unto you the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</hi> The Spirit it is our remembrancer, to bring all things to our remembrance which Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have ſpoken unto us in the word: Saith Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 14.26.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Spirit comes he ſhall bring all things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſpoken unto you,</hi> that is, the things of God ſhall be made ſo plain unto them, as if they had known them of old, as if they were well verſt in them, and the things deeply rooted in their memories. This is quite contrary to thoſe who ſay the Spirits teachings are full of myſteries, dark and obſcure, and hard to be underſtood: What is this but to make the Spirit of God like the impure ſpirit the devil? Indeed when Oracles were in uſe, the devils anſwers were very obſcure; witneſs, when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſent to the Oracle to know whether he ſhould overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:115586:115"/>overcome him, the anſwer was ſo dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he could not underſtand either of them, before the ſword decided the doubt on the <hi>Romans</hi> part,
<q>Aiote Aeacida, Romanos vincere poſſe.</q> But the Spirit of God teacheth plainly, and when he ſpeaks, he ſpeaks to the purpoſe. If the Spirits teachings ſhould be obſcure, who ſhould interpret the minde of the Spirit, there is none that can reſolve the Spirits meanings, but the Spirit it ſelf; this is the great reſolver of all doubts and queſtions. Wouldſt thou be reſolved whether thou art a childe of God or no,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> the Spirit will tell thee. <hi>God hath ſent the Spirit of his Son crying in our hearts Abba father.</hi> The Spirit of God <hi>witneſſeth with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Spirits teachings are irreſiſtible teachings: <hi>Acts</hi> 6.10. And <hi>they were not able to reſiſt the wiſdom and the Spirit by which</hi> Stephen <hi>ſpake, i. e.</hi> the writings of God upon <hi>Stephens</hi> heart, or the teachings of the Spirit were ſo evident upon him, that they could not withſtand him, or oppoſe what he ſaid. When the Spirit comes, it ſhall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115586:115"/>convince the world of ſinne, of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of righteouſneſs: It ſhall convince, if it doth not convert. It ſhall either drive thee beſides thy ſelf,<note place="margin">☜</note> and make thee deſpair of ſalvation, or to go out of thy ſelf, and to truſt in Jeſus Chriſt. There is no oppoſing the Spirit, when he comes with the prevailings of grace upon thy heart. It is ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he ſpake as one that had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>and not as the Scribes:</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpake by the Spirit: <hi>My words,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are ſpirit and they are life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.63.</note> Let there be never ſo much oppoſition in the heart, never ſo much prevalency of ſinne, let the ſoul be kept never ſo faſt bound and ſetter'd with the vanities of the world, with the devices of Satan, and with the deceitfulneſs of ſinne. Yea ſuppoſing thou wert faſt aſleep in the midnight of earnall ſecurity, yet if the Spirit comes and joggs, as the Angel did <hi>Peter,</hi> we ſhall preſently awake,<note place="margin">Act. 12.7.</note> and the priſon doors ſhall be open, and our fetters ſhall be knockt off, and we ſhall be ſet at liberty. It is our miſery, that when God comes to deal with his Spirit for our ſouls good, the Spirit doth not finde us ſitting ſtill and quiet, and out
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115586:116"/>of the way to heaven, but poſting with all ſpeed in a quite contrary way as faſt as we can to hell. We do not only by nature not love God, but we hate God, and preferre ſinne and the devil before him. Now, when the Spirit comes, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing we are at the very brink of hell, juſt dropping in, yet if we hear the voice of the Spirit, that voice which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.12.</note> a voice behind thee ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it,</hi> we ſhall return and be as fire-brands pluckt out of the fire. The Spirit when it comes to write the things of God upon our hearts, it doth not finde our ſouls a <hi>raſa tabula,</hi> a meer blank, wherein there is nothing written; but the rudiments of the world, of the fleſh, and of ſinne are naturally written upon them, the devil is engrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pourtrayed all abroad upon the heart of a wicked man. Now the finger of God can preſently blot out this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and unteach us whatſoever the fleſh, the devil, and the world hath taught us, and write his own characters, as it were, with the juyce of an onyon, never to be blotted out again.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.25.</note> It is ſaid in the Goſpel of <hi>John, the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Sonne of God, and live,</hi> that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115586:116"/>is, thoſe that are dead in ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, that are ſpiritually dead, that have no ſpirituall life, that do not reliſh the things of God, that cannot move one foot towards heaven, when the Spirit cals (which is meant by the voice of Chriſt) like thoſe dry bones which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of, they ſhall ariſe and walk, and live the life of faith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my waies to do them.</hi> When the Spirit teacheth,<note place="margin">Iſa. 32.4.</note> 
                  <hi>the heart of the raſh ſhall underſtand know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the tongue of the ſtammerers ſhall be ready to ſpeak plainly.</hi> No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall impediment, no indiſpoſition can hinder the effects of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They are arbitrary teachings. As <hi>the winde bloweth where it liſteth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit teacheth when it liſteth, and where it liſteth. The Spirit is a free agent, bound to none, and whatſoever he doth,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.25.</note> he doth it freely. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things frem the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes, even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight. By the ſame Spirit is given ſeverall giſts,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115586:117"/>but all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf ſame Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.11.</note> 
                  <hi>dividing to every man ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as he will.</hi> The Spirit of God, out of a family perhaps it teacheth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and leaveth the ſervant in darkneſs; the childe, and leaves the father in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as Chriſt ſaid in the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24.41.</note> 
                  <hi>there ſhall be two a grinding in the mill. the one ſhall be taken and the other left;</hi> ſo ſay I, in the ſame ſeat, at the ſame time, there be many a hearing of the word together, and the Spirit may come and teach one, and leave all the reſt in darkneſs. What a mercy is it therefore to thee, whoſoever thou art, to thee, I ſay, that art ſo highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to have the Spirit to be thy teacher, that the Lord ſhould open thine eyes to ſee the ugly nature of ſinne, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in Jeſus Chriſt. Why might'ſt thou not have been one of the ignorant, prophane world? one that never kneweſt experimentally and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, what it is to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt? what it is to ſit down at Chriſts table, and to eat of the feaſt of fat things which he hath prepared for thee? Why maiſt thou not have lived under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of the old Law, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115586:117"/>had but the glimmerings of the Spirit, but that thou ſhouldſt live under the Goſpel? And why under the Goſpel ſhouldſt thou have a more plentifull meaſure of the Spirit, than others? but becauſe it is the Spirits pleaſure it ſhould be ſo: <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight.</hi> As Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, though in another ſenſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16, 17. <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee the things which you ſee, and the ears which hear the things which you hear;</hi> ſo I may ſay to you that live under the teachings of the Spirit in theſe Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee the things which you ſee, and the ears which hear the things which you hear. And as Chriſt ſaid to the woman that came to him ſaying,<note place="margin">Luke 11.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is the womb which bare thee, and the paps which gave thee ſuck; Nay,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>rather bleſſed are they which hear the Word of God, and do it:</hi> So ſay I, Bleſſed are they that hear the voice of the Spirit ſpeaking in their hearts, and walk up to this voice of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, They are determinating, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quieting teachings. They fix the ſoul in the waies of God. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all the doubts and carnall reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115586:118"/>which are in our hearts, and quite ſtop the mouth of fleſh and blood. When <hi>Paul</hi> had received the Spirit, how couragious was he in the work of the Lord, he that formerly was mad with fury againſt the Church of God, how ſtrongly doth he row the other way. As ſoon as ever <hi>Ananias</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Brother Saul receive thy ſight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> his eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and his heart enlarged in the knowledge of God, he preſently goes about his Maſters buſineſs to win ſouls over by the evidence of the Spirit, to the obedience of the word: Yea he was ready, not only to be bound for the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">☞</note> but to ſuffer for him. A ſpiritual man he chooſeth and pitcheth upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſerious deliberation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, being helped by the light of the Spirits teachings, I ſay he chooſeth God for his God, and Chriſt for his Chriſt, and the Spirit for his Spirit, and the Word for his rule, and Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his delight.<note place="margin">An impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith.</note> Many Chriſtians have but an implicit faith for what they believe, ſome believe the Word of God becauſe they were taught ſo, and ſo were inſtructed by education: others believe ſo, becauſe it is the generall opinion of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115586:118"/>moſt men; others becauſe this way ſeems the beſt to their corrupt naturall reaſon; others there are, becauſe ſuch a man ſaid ſo, becauſe they are perhaps enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him in Church-ſociety, when they have no ground in their own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, why they cloſe with this rather than with that. The devil will have a ſhrewd combate with this mans faith in the hour of temptation, when he ſhall come to die.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, efflagitavit</note> The devil hath deſired to winnow thee, as he did <hi>Peters</hi> faith: He will try thee of what mettall thou art made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art droſs or ſilver, he will ſift thee throughly (and if thou art found wanting, as I am ſure thou wilt be found, for this faith hath no foundation) thou ſhalt be caſt forth as chaff out of Chriſts floor, to be burned for ever. What is the reaſon that we drive on ſo ſlowly for heaven, why? it is becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſs of our ſpirits. We do not walk by fixed principles. Go to this point, whether the Word be the Word of God, were you never under the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings of Satan for a while concerning this thing) hardly any but ſome times or other have been under ſuch a cloud of temptation. If you were really fixed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115586:119"/>upon this principle, that the Scripture is the Word of God, reading what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments attends ſinners in their evil cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and what happineſs follows the Saints, there could not be ſuch a general ſpirit of prophanneſs amongſt men as there is, and that little care to walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the preciſeneſs of the Goſpel. The Spirit quiets our mindes concerning this doubt, by diſcovering unto us the majeſty, purity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it. A ſpiritual man can ſay, <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>I know what I ſpeak, I know that God is true, and that there is no unrighteouſneſs in him: God is in me of a truth.</hi> Beſides, have we not Atheiſticall thoughts of God, like that fool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. who <hi>ſaid in his heart, there was no God,</hi> denying the providence of God? When we ſee the wicked men of the world proſper, and we our ſelves counted the offscouring of it; are we not ready to ſay like <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 27.1.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul?</hi> or that we ſhall fall of everlaſting happineſs? God hath caſt us off for ever, calling the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God liars, who ſpeak unto us in the name of the Lord, and to diſtruſt the word of promiſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I will never leave
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115586:119"/>thee nor forſake thee,</hi> where there are five negatives for the confirmation of it, I will never, never, never, never, never leave thee nor forſake thee.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> Now as <hi>David</hi> when he went into the Sanctuary of God, he was better principle'd, and underſtood their latter end; that God had ſet them in ſlippery places, that they might fall and not riſe again. So if we would wait till the Spirit comes down upon our hearts, we ſhould have all theſe carnall reaſonings, and theſe fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubts removed, and we ſhould be ſetled in the truths of God. When a man is taught by the Spirit, he doth not ſtand to reaſon with fleſh and blood (ſhall I do this, or ſhall I do that, ſhall I chooſe heaven, or ſhall I chooſe hell, ſhall I chooſe ſinne, or ſhall I chooſe grace, ſhall I chooſe God, or ſhall I chooſe Baal) he doth not ſtand reaſoning the caſe, Shall I be religious, or ſhall I not? Shall I truſt all upon Gods bare promiſe, or ſhall I cloſe with the pleaſures of ſin, which are really preſent? but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently renouncing all thoſe carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings which ariſe from fleſh and blood, preſently ſets upon the work of the Lord, knowing that his labour ſhall not be in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115586:120"/>vain in the Lord. So did <hi>Paul.</hi> Gal. 1. 15, 16. When the Lord had endued him with his Spirit ſutable for his calling whereunto he was called, he ſtood not to reaſon with fleſh and blood, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſets upon his great Maſters buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">The great danger there is in conſulting with fleſh and blood.</note> This conſulting with fleſh and blood hinders many a poor ſoul from a through cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt. Fleſh will ſay, Do not cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, do not ſerve God, you had better take a certainty for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and thoſe preſent enjoyments here, and live merrily. In conſulting with fleſh and blood, you conſult with the enemy of Jeſus Chriſt, of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his grace, and with an enemy to your own ſouls. Be ſure the fleſh will decide the controverſle on the devils part againſt Jeſus Chriſt. Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God determines the matter on Chriſts part againſt the devil, teaching thee the inſufficiency of all the creatures to make thee happy, and the true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only reſides in God, putting thee into the way wherein God is to be found, and preſerving thee in the ſame, that at length thou maiſt reap ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:115586:120"/>
               <p>Seventhly, The teachings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are conſonant to the Word; they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Word of God. As the minde of the Spirit in one place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture agrees with the minde of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in another, and there is a ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the Word of God: So the teachings of the Spirit upon our hearts, they alſo are correſpondent with the word. Saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>If an Angel from heaven ſhould deliver any other doctrine unto you, than what you have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> And the Apoſtle by a reſumption or ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation repeats it again; <hi>If any man teach any other Goſpel unto you than what you have received, let him be accurſed:</hi>

                     </gap>.11, 12.</note> And why? My Doctrine is not of fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<note place="margin">Note this well ☜</note> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, My word which I have delivered unto you being the Word of God, and ſeeing I have received it from God, I am certain God will not ſend a meſſage contrary to his Word, or ſend an Angel from heaven to infirm and weaken that which I have delivered unto you: So I ſay,<note place="margin">☜</note> whoſoever thou art that pretendeſt to revelations and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and high diſcoveries from God, if
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115586:121"/>the manifeſtations you pretend to be to draw you to the promoting of any thing contrary to the Word of God, or to encourage you in the waies of ſinne, and to carry on the intereſts of the fleſh, it is a lying Spirit, it is not the Spirit of God. I am ſure God will not ſend a meſſage to contradict his own Word, or give in a revelation which ſhall weaken and deſtroy that word which his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets have delivered unto us. I could wiſh that, the Quakers of our times, who pretend ſo much to the Spirit,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are void of the Spirits teachings.</note> and yet walk after the fleſh, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying and reviling the precious ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, their mouths being black with helliſh imprecations againſt the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, would lay this to heart. Certainly they are void of the Spirits teachings upon their hearts, if any people in the world are void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo full of malice againſt the Word of God, which is the minde of the Spirit, and ſo impetuouſly carried by a ſpirit of envy (An envious perſon is the very picture of the devil) againſt thoſe who watch for their ſouls good, that they may be ſaved at the great day of account, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.11. <hi>To the Law and

               <p n="3">3. After the devils revelations there follows great diſquietneſs of minde, and little ſettlement of ſpirit, but they are left in manifold perplexities, ſometimes the light that is within them, as they call it, carrying them to ſuch a place, and ſometimes to another, and whatſoever the light bids them do, that they muſt do. As the evil ſpirit hurried Chriſt up and down, ſetting him upon the pinacle of the Temple, but the teachings of the Spirit bring peace of conſcience and joy in the holy Ghoſt, which is unſpeakable and full of glory, Saith Chriſt, <hi>When the Spirit comes, it ſhall ſpeak of me, and ſhall bring all things to your remembrance,

As Chriſt by a-word did raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave; ſo God by one word, by his Spirit, can raiſe us up from the grave of ſinne to newneſs of life.

Now they cannot ſpiritually diſcern grace, for in regard of ſpirituall diſcerning they are in the dark, even as the eyes if they would ſee without light, the eye-ſight and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the excellency of the ball will not avail to make them ſee; ſo the wicked, even the learned'ſt of them all, they cannot ſee grace, becauſe they have not the Spirit of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light; their learning &amp; their wit, and all their good parts cannot ſuffice to deſcry the things of God as they are ſeen by the godly.

All theſe falſe concluſions come from corrupt fleſh, becauſe they are not inlightened by the Spirit of God. <hi>John</hi> 2.11. <hi>He that walketh in the dark knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi> You are all in the dark unleſs you have the Spirit. If the people of the world had the eyes of the children of God, they could not but love grace and holineſs, and Chriſt, and the Word, and the Miniſters, for the beauty and the excellency that is in them.

What is the reaſon that <hi>David</hi> prayed ſo often, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold the wondrous things of thy Law: Teach me thy ſtatutes.

When the earnall men of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the children of God for their zeal and conſtancy in his waies, and for their preciſeneſs in living up to the terms of the Goſpel; they may anſwer them as one did his fellow in another caſe for looking upon a picture; ſaid his fellow, Why doſt thou gaze upon it ſo long? O ſaith he, if you did ſee with my eyes, and had that skill to diſcern as I have, you would gaze upon it as long too: So if you did ſee with our light, and had that Spirit of diſcerning which we have, you would be as eager in the waies of God, as we poſſibly can be. Wicked men are not able to judge aright of the worth of grace, and of the excellency of the things above as they ſhould do, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preferre <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Chriſt, and ſinne before grace; but the godly on the contrary they cry out with that godly Martyr <hi>Lambert; None but Chriſt, Nothing but grace;</hi> Give us grace and Chriſt and it ſufficeth us.

The exceſs and immoderate uſe of a thing, eſpecially when the thing is unlawfull in it ſelf, may be called drunkenneſs; as the Prophet cries forth, <hi>O ye that are drunken, but not with wine,</hi> Iſa. 29.9.

His ſervants we are whom we obey; in the ſervice of God there is perfect freedom, but in the ſervice of the devil there is the greateſt ſlavery: What more ſlaviſh than to ſerve a luſt? What greater bondage can there be than to have the devil our Maſter? When the Spirit of God hath ſanctified us and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed us, then we bear the Image of our heavenly Father, according to that place in <hi>John, He that is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and he that is born of the Spirit is ſpirit;</hi> that is, he that is born of the fleſh, bears the image of the fleſh; and he that is born of the Spirit, the image of the Spirit. As he that is born of corrupt fleſh is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſo he that is born of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is holy. Likewiſe we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the rudiments of the world, and thoſe ſuperſtitious waies wherein the world walketh. How many are there kept in bondage to old cuſtoms in the worſhip of God, to Ceremonies and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115586:132"/>ſerving of God after the tradition of their fathers; that ſtand upon places and outward form, more than the inward and more ſpirituall part of worſhip? Some cavil at the Churches, calling them Steeple-houſes, and the Pulpit a Tub, and the ſervants of God Tub-preachers. If the Church of God be a Steeple-houſe, what place may we term their private meetings? wherein the ſubject matter of their diſcourſe is to broach and vent forth new fangled notions, nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall to the ſalvation of their ſouls, and how they may vilifie and caſt contempt upon the true worſhip of God, and upon the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. Others put too much upon theſe places, as if there were an inward holineſs in them, as if God would rather hear them there, and anſwer them for the place ſake, rather than at another place. Under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there is no place more holy than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for it is not the place that makes the duty holy, as it was under the Law, when the Altar ſanctified the gift, and not the gift the Altar; but duties now put a dignity upon the place, and not the place put a dignity upon the duties. So that this place, the Church, while
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115586:132"/>we are praying it may be called the houſe of prayer, and while we are doing Gods work, and God is manifeſting himſelf unto us, it may be called the houſe of God: As <hi>Jacob</hi> called the place where he had his viſion, The houſe of God. But yet you muſt obſerve this by the way, that under the Goſpel-diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is not ſo much put upon pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as there was under the Law. God under the former diſpenſation did more immediatly limit his preſence to one place, though not alwaies, for God is found of all them that diligently ſeek him, but his viſible preſence is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Temple, and to his ſhining forth between the Cherubims, over the Mercy-ſeat: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.20. God is ſaid <hi>to put his Name</hi> into the Temple, and the Pſaſmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.1. <hi>O thou that ſhineſt forth between the Cherubims,</hi> in alluſion to Gods manifeſting himſelf over the Mercy-ſeat! Therefore it was <hi>Jeroboams</hi> ſin which the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> reproves, that he did not only ſet up Calves to be worſhipped inſtead of the true God, but that he ſet them up in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> keeping the people from the place of Gods worſhip, where God had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115586:133"/>put his Name. Yet under this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation the Church it may be called a holy place, as under the old Law many things are called holy in that it is ſeparated and ſet apart in a publick way, in oppoſition to meeting houſes, for the pure worſhip of God, and a joynt calling upon him in his own way. The Spirit likewiſe puts us into a ſtate of liberty: A ſtate of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it is a ſtate of liberty.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.11</note> Therefore we are ſaid to be tranſlated from the Kingdom of darkneſs into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

Now you know a childe when he is under age, he differs nothing from a ſervant, but is under Governours and Tutors, till he comes to be heir and Lord of all things. A reverent Divine whom I heard occaſionally, ſaid that there were four priviledges which attend Adoption. 1. Liberty. 2. Right and title. 3. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: and 4. Boldneſs. Now how come we to be the Sons of God, but by the Spirit, the Spirit witneſſeth with our ſpirits that we are the children of God. This ſpirituall freedom it is not ſuch a freedom as the world dreams of;<note place="margin">☞</note> it doth not exempt us from the obedience to the

God ſevers the light from the ſmoak when it aſcends up into heaven, the light is the Spirits, the ſmoak is ours.<note place="margin">Having the Spirit we muſt go along with him, pouring forth thoſe deſires which he ſuggeſteth unto us: the fire which God would have continually to burn upon his Altar, came out from the Lord: <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.24.

He may wraſtle with God and never let him alone till he obtain the bleſſing, or ſome gracious anſwer to his prayer, though not in the ſame kind he petitioned for. He can ſay, I am thy

Now is it ſo, that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, is it not too too evident that the greateſt part of profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are void of the Spirit: Are they not in bondage to ſome ſecret luſt? Doth not their ſpeech bewray them? in ſtead of ſpeaking the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> do they not ſpeak the language of <hi>Aſhdod?</hi> In ſtead of being led by the Spirit of God, are they not led by the ſpirit of the world? While they talk of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do they not walk after the fleſh? Have they not the Spirit to talk by, and the world to walk by? Are they not in love with the faſhion of the world, and intangled with the rudiments of it?

               <p>Secondly, Is it ſo, That none can know the things of God, but they that have the teachings of the Spirit upon their hearts, Then I beſeech you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to give you the teachings of his Spirit.

                  <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for his love is better then Wine.</hi> Theſe words hold forth three things. 1.

That this familiarity and mutual love between Chriſt and his Church comes in by his Word, and by the teachings of his Spirit; he doth not ſay with the kiſſes of his lipps, but with the kiſſes of his mouth; the word <hi>[Kiſſes]</hi> is taken in Scripture for flattering, ſoft,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115586:153"/>and pleaſant words, ſhewing forth ſome love and charity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kiſſes of an enemy are deceitful.</hi> The Churches deſire is, that Chriſt would inſtruct her by his Word and Spirit, for his love is better then wine. 3. The love of Chriſt in the kiſſes of his mouth to his Spouſe, is better then wine; all the compariſons in this book of <hi>Canticles</hi> are drawn from things which do moſt of all title our minds and delight our ſenſes; Wine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe things which belong to the taſte, is the ſweeteſt. The love of Chriſt in the teachings of his Spirit, is better then all things, better then Wine, then Wine which maketh glad the heart of man. If Chriſts love in the kiſſes of his mouth be better then wine, then certainly the joys which come in by the teachings of Gods Spirit, are better then the joys which come in by wine; all the joyes which come in by theſe carnal delights are of a periſhing nature, as ſoon as the act is paſt, the pleaſure is paſt. A drunkard as ſoon as his cup is down, the pleaſure vaniſheth; but the joyes that come in by the Spirits teachings are abiding joyes, all other joyes have a ſting at the end of

He that hath the light of the Spirit will diſcern therein a ſecret and hidden Manna which the world knoweth not of; As the dew deſcendeth upon the ground, and rejoyceth the earth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to flouriſh; ſo the Spirits teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are by the dew to refreſh the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and drooping Spirit, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. <hi>I will be at the dew unto Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lily, and caſt forth his roots as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> Dent. 32.2.

Chriſt ownes whatſoever is of his Spirit in us, a little faith if it be true ſhall have its reward, and ſo ſhould we do; Chriſt acknowledged a little ſtrength in the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Rev. 3.8. <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word,</hi>

A meek ſpirit is of a docible diſpoſition, ready to receive, and moſt apt to retain: moſt thankfull for what he hath, and ever mindfull of its own unworthineſs. Now here for to prevent miſtaking, I ſhould ſhew the nature of meekneſs, to wit, what this meekneſs is,<note place="margin">Severall kindes of meekneſs.</note> but I ſhall only ſhew the ſeverall kindes of meekneſs, which are four.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A naturall meekneſs, ariſing out of the conſtitution of a mans body.</item>
                  <item>2. A morall meekneſs, ariſing from good precepts, inſtructions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</item>
                  <item>3. A ſtoicall meekneſs, which is a ſameneſs of ſpirit upon all occaſions, this is rather a ſtupidity then a meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                  <item>4. An artificiall meekneſs, which is when men can reſtrain their paſſions, though their heart is as full of envy as it can hold. Such was <hi>Eſans</hi> meekneſs to <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. A true meekneſs,<note place="margin">A true meekneſs what it is.</note> which is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall frame of heart, whereby a man
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115586:161"/>gives no provocation, and is ready to receive any, and whereby a man mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſubordinates, and governs all his anger to the glory of God, and to the good of others. Meekneſs is paſſions jaylor. True meekneſs is not alwaies the ſame, but when Gods glory is blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any waies diminiſhed, then it turns to zeal and an holy anger.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.20, 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt man upon the earth, when he ſaw the idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he broke forth into an holy anger, being grieved in his ſpirit for the diſhonour done to God.</item>

None but Noblemen, Lords and Dukes might be made partakers of State-ſecrets; the godly are heavenly Lords and Nobles, and the privy States men of heavens Court. Such honour have all the Saints to know the things of God.</note> 
                     <hi>him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe. The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> Mal. 4.2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that fear my name ſhall the ſun of righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi> The fear of God it puts a bridle
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115586:161"/>to our luſts and corrupt affections which choak the things of God. As an unruly horſe may be curb'd with a bit and a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; ſo the fear of God it is as it were a bit and a bridle to curb the extravagancy and the breaking forth of ſinne. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to depart from evil.</hi> As a brick wall keepeth in the waters from overflowing the ground and banks, from breaking in upon the meadows, ſo the fear of God puts a ſtop to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of many a ſin, which otherwiſe we ſhould commit. Now when the ſtrength and the power, and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſinne is taken away, the Spirit comes in with more freedom into the ſoul. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was tempted by his Miſtreſs unto uncleanneſs, he having the fear of God before his eyes, refuſed her with this ſaying, <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſinne againſt my God!</hi>

And <hi>Joſeph</hi> becauſe he feared God, had the ſpirit of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation given him that he could interpret dreams. He expounded the chief Butlers and Bakers dream, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115586:162"/>And the Lord honoured him in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his ſervants. <hi>By hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and the fear of the Lord come riches,</hi>

The ſalvation of the Lord is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our Land.</hi> The fear of Gods glorious Majeſty, and unqueſtionable authority, puts the ſoul into a fit capacity to be taught by the Spirit. As long as a man is preſumptuous, ſelf-confident, and thinks himſelf ſomewhat when he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there is no place for any doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. God uſually puts men into great fears and terrours, and then raiſeth them up, before he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115586:162"/>himſelf unto them: <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.33. <hi>I will put my fear before them, and write my law in their hearts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Severall kindes of fear.</note> There is a fourfold fear.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. A naturall fear, which in it ſelf is not ſinfull, becauſe God hath put this affection of fear into our hearts. So Chriſt feared to die.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſervile or a ſlaviſh fear, when men fear God, not for his goodneſs, but only for his juſtice and his greatneſs: Contrary to the Prophet, who ſaith, <hi>Fear the Lord and his goodneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 3.5.</note> When they fear God as a conſuming fire, but not as a gracious Father. When they fear to offend out of a ſenſe of hell, and not out of any love they bear to God.</p>

When they conſider what an ocean of love was ſhewed unto them by God, when they lay wallowing in their blood, by pitying them in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhewing them mercy in Jeſus Chriſt. The love of God conſtrains a Saint to an obedience of him. And a childe of God hath ſuch ingenuity in him, and ſuch a ſon-like affection to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115586:163"/>God his Father, that he would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grieve him for the whole world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A reverentiall fear, ſo the Angels in heaven they are ſaid to fear God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do him reverence. The Saints reverence God,<note place="margin">Rev. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>caſting down their Crowns before him that ſitteth upon the Throne.</hi> That vaſt diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the creature, he being the fountain and we the ſtreams; who hath his being of himſelf, depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none, and we continually depending upon him; cannot but work a reverence and a godly ſear in the hearts of thoſe that love him and embrace him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If thou haſt the Spirits teachings upon thy ſpirit, upon thy heart, thou wilt ſtill deſire to have further diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Spirit upon thy heart. Thou wilt much be exerciſed in all thoſe waies and means the Spirit uſeth to come down. Much in private prayer, in that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty of ſpirituall meditation, much at home with thy ſelf, and leſs gadding abroad in thy deſires and affections. There was a time when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                  <hi>for thy ſervant heareth.</hi> Let not <hi>Moſes,</hi> or thy ſervants only inſtruct me, but rather do thou ſpeak, my Lord God, by thy Spirit in my heart, who art the enlightner of all the Prophets, for thou alone with them canſt perfectly inſtruct me, but they without thee can profit nothing. As <hi>Mary</hi> ſate down at Chriſts feet to hear the gracious words which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his mouth, ſo thou wilt wait at the Ordinances to have more flowings in of the Spirit upon thee.<note place="margin">☜</note> When a ſoul ſhall remember, at ſuch a time ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall truth was imparted unto me, at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place I was convinced that ſuch a thing was a ſinne, and by the power of the Spirit overcome to a forſaking of it: that ſuch a thing was a duty; that I was ſetled in my mind concerning ſuch a Tenet; that I had a fuller aſſurance of Gods love upon my heart than formerly; this will make the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115586:164"/>ſoul pant and breath after a more full manifeſtation of ſpirituall things. As <hi>David</hi> cries out,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.2.</note>

As it is impoſſible for a man at once to look upwards towards heaven, and downwards towards the earth; ſo it is impoſſible for a Chriſtian with one and the ſame judgement and affection, to look upon earthly and heavenly things. He counts the riches and honours and pleaſures of the world, but as crumbs caſt to dogs; but as triviall things not worth the mentioning, in compariſon of the enjoyment of God in Chriſt. He is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115586:164"/>reſolved not to be put off with thoſe common mercies, and not to receive his good things in this life; but he tramples upon all theſe things under the Moon, as mutable, and that paſs away, having his eye fixt upon that eternall weight of glory in heaven, and upon that Crown of bliſs and happineſs reſerved for him.<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> As children when they come to be men they put away childiſh things, bowling-ſtones, counters, and all other vain and fooliſh ſports and pleaſures, and become more ſerious and ſolid, weighing what will become of them, and how they may live in the world; ſo when thou art taught of the Spirit, thou wilt abandon all former delights when thou wert in the fleſh, and count the world thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which would have kept thee from Jeſus Chriſt, yea the memory of thy vain converſation, when thou livedſt according to the courſe of the world, will be bitter unto thee, and thou wilt count all the things of this world but toys and trifles in compariſon of the true and the heavenly riches.

               <head>Now I come to ſhew what are the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary teachings of the Spirit, that ſo we may know the one from the other.</head>
               <p n="1">1. A man hath then an extraordinary teaching of the Spirit upon his heart, when he is certain God will give him the ſame thing he asked of him in prayer, in the very ſame kinde and manner he asked it of God: when he is fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and verily believes that God will grant him the very ſame thing which he asked of him. It is an extraordinary work of the Spirit upon the heart that muſt produce ſuch a ſtrong confidence in God, that God will give him the very ſame thing he deſires. When a ſoul can ſay, I know that God heareth me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and will hear me in this thing, and give me my hearts deſire, eſpecially when there is no promiſe in the word made to that particular thing which he praies for: As ſuppoſe thou hadſt a friend ſick, and thou praieſt for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and haſt ſuch a ſtrong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God by the Spirit, that thou undoubtedly believeſt that he ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115586:167"/>ſuch a confidence had <hi>Luther,</hi> when he wrote to <hi>Myconius,</hi> hearing that he was ſick, that without he ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo he did, according to <hi>Luthers</hi> prayer. So had <hi>Elijah</hi> when he prayed for rain; and Jeſus Chriſt when he did his miracles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a ſoul hath that Plerophory, that full aſſurance of faith without all doubting; then he hath an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry teaching of the Spirit upon his heart. When he can ſay with <hi>Job, I know that my redeemer liveth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 19.25</note> 
                  <hi>and though worms deſtroy my body, yet I ſhall ſee him with theſe very eyes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7.</note> And with <hi>Paul, I have fought the good fight of faith, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my courſe, hence forth there is laid up for me a Crown of life,</hi> &amp;c. When a ſoul can ſay by the full evidence of the Spirit upon his ſpirit, without the leaſt wavering or doubting, I know that both in life and death Chriſt ſhall be unto me advantage. When a ſoul can merrily and cheerfully rejoyce in the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the glory of God. Many precious Saints are without this full aſſurance till they come to die, as that godly Martyr M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Glover</hi> was, who was full of fears and doubts till he came to the ſtake, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115586:167"/>then out of a ſenſe of Jeſus Chriſt, he cries out, <hi>He is come, he is come.</hi> That is, Jeſus Chriſt was come with his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary comforts unto his ſoul; the Spirit of God ſealing unto him the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his ſinnes, and the love of Jeſus Chriſt unto his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a ſoul hath ſuch a ſpirit of zeal, courage and magnanimity in the waies of God; that though he were the Butt of the whole world, and the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtock of men and Angels for the cauſe of God, and were perſecuted on all ſides, yet he patiently can undergo it for the ſake of Chriſt. Theſe are Saints of the firſt magnitude, who have more than ordinary to other Saints, flowings in of the Spirit upon their hearts. Such were the Apoſtles; <hi>Luther, Ignatius, Athanaſius, Gregory, Nazianzen,</hi> and the like. <hi>Tempore Athanaſii totus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus gemuit ſub Ario.</hi> The Martyr <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas,</hi> who is ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.13.</note> who dwelt where Satan had his ſeat, and kept himſelf unſpotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt that wicked and perverſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and witneſſed to the truth with the loſs of his life, had an extraordinary meaſure of the Spirit upon his heart.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:115586:168"/>
               <p n="4">4. When men have an infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo that whatſoever they ſay is truth, and as it were an Oracle from God; and when upon all emergencies they have Divine influences from the Spirit of grace, then they have the extraordinary teachings of the Spirit: When they have an infallible Spirit, ſo only had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For they being univerſall meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Jeſus Chriſt, not tied to one particular place, but to plant Churches in ſeverall places, and to pen one part of the Word of God, which was to be a ſtanding rule to the end of the world, they were guided by the infallible Spirit of God; ſo that they could not erre in things which belong to faith and piety. Only the Apoſtles were infallible in their doctrine. Popes and generall Councils may erre, and have erred groſly from the faith. Alſo when upon all exigencies they have the ſupplies of the Spirit of God, then they have the extraordinary teachings of the Spirit, ſo had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: <hi>Luke</hi> 12.11. <hi>And when they bring you unto the Synagogues, and unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Powers, take ye no thought, how or what thing ye ſhall anſwer, or what ye ſhall ſay; For the holy Ghoſt ſhall teach
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115586:168"/>you in the ſame hour what ye ought to ſay.</hi> Whether the Saints in the Primitive times who ſuffered for the Goſpel, or the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies had not theſe influences of the Spirit upon their ſad exigencies, when they were brought before their cruell perſecutors, to anſwer for themſelves, is beyond all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Certainly ſilly men and women, I mean, in reſpect of any deep know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, could never on a ſudden expreſs their mindes ſo excellently concerning the things of God; had they not more than ordinary at ſuch a time the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit upon their hearts: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that woman of <hi>Exeter,</hi> mentioned in the Book of Martyrs, with many others.</p>

               <head>The times wherein the Spirits teachings are moſt manifeſt.</head>
               <p n="1">1. In times of affliction thou art moſt of all ſenſible of the teachings of the Spirit upon thy heart. In themſelves they manifeſt nothing to the ſoul but the diſpleaſure of an angry Judge, intending to deſtroy them; but the Spirit concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring along with them, and ſhewing us
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115586:169"/>the minde and will of God, they are precious cordials and purgations for the ſinne of our ſouls. If afflictions could make us hearken to the voice of God, and ſavingly inſtruct us and teach us thoſe things which concern our everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting peace, why do not many wicked wretches who live under the ſcourge of the Almighty all their daies? who have one wave of affliction after another upon them, learn obedience by the rod, and underſtand the minde and intent of God. Afflictions in themſelves are neither good nor evil, but accordingly as they are improved by us through the help of the Spirit according to the will of God. Now although the Spirit hath written the things of God long before upon our hearts, yet the manifeſtation of thoſe things moſt of all is apparent to us, when God doth inſtruct us by his rod, together with his Spirit, that thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which for a long time were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by us, being preſſed down by affliction, may ſend forth a precious ſmell in the noſtrils of our God, and to the ſenſe of others. We learn by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; 1. To ſee thoſe things which we never perceived to be in us before, to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115586:169"/>wit, the actings of divine grace in us, ſupporting us and carrying us along chearfully through this valley of <hi>Baca;</hi> and the actings of our ſpirit towards God again in way of filiall affection, and ſon-like obedience under his hand, being taught by the Spirit what the mind of God is concerning them. As no man knoweth the vileneſs of his heart, till God is pleaſed to let Satan have his liberty to tempt him, and his own hearts luſts to draw him aſide: So none can know the prevailings of grace upon his own heart, and the efficacy of divine teachings, and the triall and experience of thoſe things which are written upon his heart till God ſhall bring him under the fiery triall. The Spirit hath taught us that all truſt and confidence is to be repoſed in God alone, becauſe God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to deliver us, and that we may thereby be quit and ſet free from all thoſe diſtracting fears which do mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt us: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit thy waies unto the Lord, that thy thoughts may be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Now our confidence in God is then moſt of all exerciſed, when all other props and ſtaies do fail us, and we caſt our ſelves under the arms of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115586:170"/>God. We know not our own ſtrength againſt the temptations of ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that we are fortified with the whole armour of God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> to wit, the ſhield of faith, the helmet of hope, the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of righteouſneſs, the ſword of the Spirit, the Spirit of prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the inward ſupport and aid of the Spirit of God, and the continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Jeſus Chriſt interceding for us at the right hand of his Father, that our graces fail not in the hour of tribulation, till God ſhall ſmite us with his rod. By afflictions the teachings of the Spirit of God upon our hearts are moſt known to others.<note place="margin">Rev. 14.12.</note> Here we may reade the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Saints, the ſincerity of their hearts, the power of divine grace, and the ſweetneſs of the comforts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon their hearts, when we ſee them cheerfully, willingly, and joyfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to the good pleaſure of God. 2. By afflictions we are more and more acquainted with the evil nature of ſinne which hath brought ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon us, with the holineſs of God which cannot away with ſinne and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and with the exact juſtice of God againſt it, in ſo ſeverely puniſhing of it,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115586:170"/>with the benefit that comes by ſeeking Gods face, and by walking up to the light which God hath put within us. 3. The Spirit of God is very active upon the hearts of believers at ſuch a time, in rooting out the remainders of originall corruption, and in the exciting of thoſe things which he hath put within them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Near the time of death. Sweet have been the diſcoveries of Gods Spirit upon the hearts of his children when they have been near the time of their diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe near ſuch a time Satan and all our ſpirituall enemies will muſter up all their aſſaults to weaken a believers faith, hope and confidence in God, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the believer hath been a hainous ſinner formerly, and after his converſion hath fallen into ſome groſs ſinne to the wounding of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to the quenching of the bleſſed Spirit for a time, though the ſin is done away by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and the pardon of it ſealed by the teſtimony of the Spirit, yet the devil will be pudling in this old ſore, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to the contrary, telling him
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115586:171"/>that his converſion was never reall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſince he hath fallen ſo foully in the fleſh. The devil tempted Chriſt when he was near the time of his ſuffering, to drive him from his hope and confidence in God his Father. Saith Chriſt, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14.30</note> Chriſt was perfectly holy, ſo that no temptation could take hold of him to overcome him,<note place="margin">☞</note> or to taint him with the leaſt ſinne. But we poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when the devil comes to tempt us, have ſomething in us, we have a great deal of unbelief abiding in us, we have a body of ſinne and of death, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our bullwarks would eaſily fall, our confidence in God would eaſily give place to unbelief, were not the Spirit of God <hi>which is in us, ſtronger than him who by way of eminency is in the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.4.</note> to wit, the devil. Now God on the other ſide fils a believer with continuall freſh and renewed ſupplies of his Spirit, and with new experiences of his love unto him, bringing unto his remembrance all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer loving kindneſſes paſt between God and his ſoul, what a great work was wrought upon him in the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? what various diſpenſations of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115586:171"/>Gods providence he hath undergone, and all to the benefit of his precious ſoul: what heavenly Soliloquies have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his ſoul in private Prayer and heavenly Meditations, what reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conqueſts he hath had over his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering luſts, and what ſpiritual wiſdome to diſcern the ſleights of the Devil! How often he hath had the witneſs of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon his heart, though for a ſeaſon the ſpirit hath withdrawn its teſtimony! What groans and ſighs, and daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints under the ſenſe of the burden of his ſins! What change hath been wrought upon him conſidering his vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion while he was in the fleſh, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental truths, both Theoretical and Practical for the eſtabliſhment of his ſoul in grace, have been imparted unto him, and what future hopes of glory he hath enkindled in his breſt by the operation of the ſpirit, that ſo his faith and hope might be in God alone at the hour of death!</p>
               <p n="2">2. To expreſs thoſe fears which are within us ariſing from that original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and from that unbelief which is in the beſt of Gods ſervants, which do moſt of all ſhew themſelves at ſuch a
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115586:172"/>time. A believers fears are commonly more then his hopes, when the hopes of a wicked man, and of a preſumptuous ſinner overcome all his fears. Fear it is a diſtracting paſſion filling the minde with a multitude of trembling, amazing, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, tumultuating, perplexing thoughts that a true childe of God many times is in great doubts when he comes to dye; but yet the ſpirit of God will bring in at ſuch a time, ſuch ſweet experiences of Gods love to his ſoul, of what God hath done for him, that though he may not have the full aſſurance of faith which is without any doubting at all, yet he ſhall have ſufficient motives and encouragements to keep him, as from ſinking and deſpair, and upon firme grounds to repoſe himſelf in God for ſalvation upon the account of Jeſus Chriſt. Perfect love caſteth out all ſlaviſh fear, and when once the ſoul is well grounded in this principle, that God loved him in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, of which love he hath had ſome foretaſts thereof by the earneſt of his ſpirit in his heart, there is no ground left for deſpair, but for a firme belief that God is his, and he is Gods; God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſtrongeſt arguments to oppoſe the greateſt conflicts.</p>

               <head>Now I come to anſwer thoſe doubts which ariſe from the Spirits teachings on the hearts of Believers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may we diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the teachings of the ſpirit, and that common Illumination ſpoken of in in the ſixth of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 4. verſe, which perſons being ſo enlightned may fall away finally to the perdition of their immortal ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Common illumination never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to particulars, but remaines one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in generals. A carnal man may know what faith is, what repentance is, what humiliation is, what ſelf-denial is, what ſincerity is, what new obedience is. He may know all thoſe things in a general way, but he can never come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by way of propriety unto himſelf. He cannot ſay I believe, I repent, I am truely humbled for my ſins, I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leſſon of ſelf-denial, I am ſincere, I am obedient to the will of God; but the light of the ſpirit within makes a Chriſtian to ſay experimentally, feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, out of that abundance of comfort, which he hath by reaſon of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe things upon his ſoul, that Chriſt is mine, and I am his, <hi>I have given
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115586:173"/>glory to God by believing, I have worked the works of God, I have had the ſpirit of God leading me into the Land of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note> I have that heavenly fire of love enkindled in my breſt by the divine ſparks of light from heaven,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.10.</note> which will burn for ever, ſtill aſcending to be united unto God in heaven. The valley of <hi>Baca</hi> is turned into a valley of viſion, though not the immediate fruition. The teachings of the ſpirit do make a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an go to particulars, becauſe what the ſpirit teacheth, if it be a habit, or a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication connatural to the ſoul as ſpiritual; the ſpirit worketh the ſame quality in it, The ſpirit teacheth us to believe, and the ſpirit worketh faith in us, for faith it is the gift of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Common Illumination produceth but a common faith which is rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption then true faith, a common love which is rather lukwarmneſs then the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love which is a fruit of the ſpirit, a common joy which is rather like a flaſh of lightning, then that Meridian joy of the Saints of Jeſus Chriſt, a common humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is rather an <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliation, a legal conviction upon the ſoul by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Law, then any true genuine ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115586:173"/>for the diſpleaſure done to God by their ſins, a common hope which is rather ſelf conceitedneſs and vain confidence, then that lively hope which purifies the ſoul, a common well-wiſhing to leave their ſins then a ſetled determinate reſolution to forſake them, and to turn to the Lord God with all their hearts. As a mans knowledge is, ſo is his faith, ſo is his love, ſo is his obedience. Now this knowledge which ariſeth from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon illumination, it never ſavingly works upon the heart to an hearty obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the things known, it is never joyned with true Grace; but that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which comes from the teachings of the ſpirit works a true faith in the ſoul, and is ever accompained with all the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects of the bleſſed ſpirit The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle joyns Grace and Knowledge both together, <hi>Grow in Grace and in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Common Illumination never makes a man ſerious in the ſervice of God to ſerve him conſtantly, let his condition be what it will; but as his joys and his outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are, ſo are his ſervices unto God, as
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115586:174"/>when the Mood &amp; the Fit takes them, then they will ſeem Religious, like the Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks which are mad only at the full of the Moon, when any profit or honour, or any advantage goeth along with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God; or when nothing is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered which may diſpleaſe their carnal minds, then who but they in an outward profeſſion for the ſerving of God; but the teachings of the ſpirit make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reſolute in the ways of God, like <hi>Noah,</hi> that his whole life ſhall be nothing elſe but a continual walking with his God. A true Chriſtian, let his outward ſtate and condition be what it will, yet he will be ſure not to forget his God, his Maker, his Preſerver, his All in All, in whom are all things, and in whom he enjoyes all things; but like <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as far as he can he will walk in all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord blameleſly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Common Illumination it breeds not the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, whereby a man upon good and ſolid grounds, may truely believe that he hath an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt in the Covenant of grace, and in all thoſe priviledges which belong to the Saints, becauſe the ſpirit of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115586:174"/>abides upon him, but meerly an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onative, ſelf-conceited, vain glorious, preſuming confidence that Chriſt is his and he is Chriſt, though no regard be had to thoſe qualifications which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in thoſe, in whoſe hearts Chriſt dwells by his bleſſed ſpirit. Every hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that hath been once enlightned, and taſted of the heavenly gift, and of the powers of the world to come will lay claim to the priviledges of the Saints, and of the benefits that flow upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the death and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, though their hearts were never truely wrought upon to a full and a final cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, and they never had the witneſſe of the ſpirit upon their hearts, that he is the childe of God; but the teachings of the ſpirit bring in unto the ſoul ſolid reaſons founded upon the word of God, and upon the experience of the Saints, whereby from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing premiſes he can draw a true and a real concluſion that he is Chriſts, and Chriſt is his. Juſtification and ſanctification are inſeparable, according to that golden chain of mans ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Whom he juſtified them he alſo ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that beſides the teſtimony of the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115586:175"/>ſpirit, he hath thoſe inherent principles of ſanctification within him, whereupon he may evidently conclude that he is no changeling, but a new born creature a true Citizen of the heavenly Jeruſalem, a true ſon amongſt the Native ſons of Zion.</p>
               <p>But ſome weak Believer may ſay, how may I diſtinguiſh between the Witneſs and the teſtimony of the ſpirit, that I am the childe of God; and that vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and preſumption which is in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mens hearts, who ſay they are the children of God, when they are not?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpirit doth not onely bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but fully perſwade us of this very thing upon ſolid reaſons which we finde true by our own experience that we are the children of God; therefore ſaith that knowing Apoſtle Saint <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3.14. 1 Iohn. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the brethren. Hereby know we, that we dwell in him and he in us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi> But wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men who are full of carnal confidence and ſinful preſumption have no ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſaving grace upon their ſouls, or any teſtimony, much leſs a perſwaſion
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115586:175"/>of the ſpirit that they are the children of God;<note place="margin">The grounds of carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> but this preſumption ariſeth from a bare conceit of their good eſtate, ſtill hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well of themſelves, or from the deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil, who hath beſotted their minds with his ſinfull Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirits teſtimony is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods word, and not upon any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whereſoever the ſpirits teſtimony is upon the hearts of any, there follows a hatred of ſin, zeal for the glory of God, a care and conſcience to ſerve God in all well-pleaſing; for as ſome eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do ſay, though I do not pin my faith upon any mans ſleeve, but onely as the light of the word and the light of the ſpirit teacheth me; the doctrine of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance will not make a Chriſtian ſecure and idle in the work of the Lord,<note place="margin">☜</note> but more watchful over his wayes, and more thankful for ſo great a mercy, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the love of God to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the truth; and that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Croſs of Chriſt, what love and mercy God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt, what power and wiſdom was put forth in that great work of mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115586:176"/>is of a more prevailing nature then to preach the terrors of the Law againſt ſin and ſinners, to bring men out of their natural condition, though both wayes muſt be uſed, even by fear plucking them forth out of the fire of hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quere,</hi> Whether or no are the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits teachings, or the light of the ſpirit in the heart of a Believer a ſufficient plea for him to caſt off all Ordinances, means of grace as unprofitable things under ſo clear a diſpenſation?</p>
               <p>I anſwer no,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For as Jeſus Chriſt in explaining the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did not abrogate the law or derogate any thing from the uſe and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of it,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> but only clear it from thoſe foul aſperſions which the Phariſees had caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; ſo the ſpirit in teaching us the things of God, and in enlightning our minds to underſtand his will, doth not take away the uſe of the word, but adds a further light unto it, that we may underſtand the minde of the ſpirit in it, and that all thoſe prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations by reaſon of the darkneſs of our underſtanding may be rightly placed; The Sun is full of light, but a blinde man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it. So the word is clear in it ſelf, but becauſe our underſtandings are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115586:176"/>we cannot underſtand it. Now the ſpirit of God doth five things in order to the word of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It explains it. 2. It gives a further authority unto it. 3. Shews us the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,<note place="margin">The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the word.</note> purity, and excellency of it. 4. Makes us to prize it above all things. 5. Enables us to keep it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the word of God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no Spirit but what works in and by the word, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. Received ye the ſpirit by the Law, or by the hearing of faith? Did ye not receive the ſpirit by the preaching of the doctrine of ſaving faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? The ſpirit teacheth, which is conſonant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God; ſo that the word and the ſpirit both concurr toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſpirit as the principal agent, the word as the inſtrument which can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the ſpirit to teach us the will of God; and to work in us all thoſe ſaving Graces which accompany ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Prayer alſo is a ſtanding duty required of all Chriſtians while they are on this ſide heaven, that thereby their faith and hope in God might be exerciſed. We are commanded to pray continually,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115586:177"/>that is, to let no time wherein this duty is required of us.<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe a Believer ſtands in need of continual food and nouriſhment, that the tent of the word, and the Bread and Wine Sacramentally ſo underſtood ſhould be continually put in his mouth whilſt he is under age in reſpect of that perfection and ripeneſs he ſhall attain unto when this mortal life ſhall be ſwallowed up in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that his ſoul might be nouriſh'd up unto everlaſting life. Likewiſe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>below we ſtand in need of many things, ſtrength of grace to overcome ſin, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under adverſity, the arm of God to ſupport us under all our weakneſſes, heavenly comforts, daily ſupplies of the ſpirit of grace, renewed arts of Divine aſſiſtance continually, bread for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, food for our ſouls; therefore we ought to make our requeſts by prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God daily for all temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> When we have the greater light, what need have we of the leſſer, when we have the Sun-light, what need have we of the Star-light, when we have the light of the ſpirit, what need have we of the light of the word, when we have that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115586:178"/>which ſupplieth all our wants, what need we pray, what need have we of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the ſpirit can ſupply all our wants without the uſe of the means?</p>
               <p n="4">4. In reſpect of our ſelves the light of the ſpirit is to be preferred before the light of the word, but ſeeing that the light of the word is ſubordinate to the light of the ſpirit, and that the light of the word, and the light of the ſpirit do not differ in reſpect of the ſubject matter, but onely in reſpect of manifeſtation, and the ſpirit enlightens in and by the word, therefore the light of the ſpirit doth not take away the uſe of the light of the word; beſides the compariſon doth not hold, becauſe the collation between the light of the Sun and Stars, and the light of the word and of the ſpirit halts, and is imperfect. The ſpirit enlightens our minds in and by the word, but the Sun ſhines of its ſelf, and not in and by the Stars. The ſpirit likewiſe though it can ſupply all our wants without the uſe of means, yet it never ordinarily doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of the means; God gives his ſpirit onely to thoſe that pray for it, and when we have the ſpirit, we are ſtill to deſire God that his ſpirit may exert his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115586:178"/>power upon us, and act in us and by us, that we may not onely have the ſpirit but feel the operations of the ſpirit upon our hearts. God knows what we want be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray, and can give us them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our asking, but God will have us pray that thereby we might acknowledge his power, his goodneſs, his mercy, and the like, and that thereby our faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience might be made manifeſt. If upon the account of the indwelling of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the hearts of the godly, they ſhould forbear to pray. I would know of thoſe who ſay ſo, why the Spirit of God is termed the ſpirit of prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in the prophecy of <hi>Zachariah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zech. 12.10.</note> but onely becauſe it ſtirs up in us good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and holy affections, and puts words into our mouths, acceptable words, whereby our petitions may be accepted of God. Let them likewiſe anſwer the portion of Scripture if they can in the ſixth of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> 18. <hi>Praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance and ſupplication for all Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If we ſhould onely hearken to the voice of the ſpirit, and to the ſpirits teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115586:179"/>in our hearts, there would be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the true Religion, when there can be no Character given by which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt might be diſtinguiſhed from our owne proper ſpirit, as from the ſpirit the divel which ſometimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf into an Angel of light. That is, the pretences of a mans own ſpirit, or of the divel in the hearts of others may ſeem ſo true and real to a man himſelf, as if they were doctrines taught by the bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now how ſhould we try the ſpirits whether they be of God or no? but by the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It is a true ſigne of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, when of that which we believe or do we are perſwaded of, and rooted in without any ambiguity or doubting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a falſe ſign, for the Turks and Infidels are as much obſtinated and ſetled in their own doctrines &amp; Traditions, yea more ſetled then moſt of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who pretend ſo much to the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ſome may ſay, though we grant you that the teachings of the ſpirit do not in themſelves make us to be above the Ordinances of God, and the meanes of Grace, yet may we not then when we

               <p>I anſwer, No.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, that in theſe places of Scripture is only held forth a more plentifull giving of the Spirit under Goſpel-times, than under the former diſpenſations: Therefore it is ſaid, that

                  <hi>the Spirit was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet aſcended.</hi> The perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which propheſie was upon the Apoſtles, together with other elected Saints, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Hence then is no place given for Enthuſiaſms, becauſe it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall with the Prophets of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they did ſpeak of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration or amplification of the Church of God to ſet it forth Tropically under figures and ſhadows, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. with many other places. For that place in the Epiſtle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> it holds forth unto us this, that for thoſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall truths which the Saints had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, from which the falſe Apoſtles did ſeek to remove them, they needed not again to be re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, theſe truths being ſet home upon their ſpirits by the Spirit of God, but only words of exhortation to ſtirre them up to execute and to put in practice thoſe fundamentall truths which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But what ſay you to that paſſage of Scripture in the 2 of <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19. where it is ſaid, <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of propheſie, whereunto you do well that ye take herd, as unto a light that ſhineth in a

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle in theſe words doth not take away the uſe of the word, and other means of grace; but the ſcope of the place as I gather from the context, rather tends to the eſtabliſhing of the word, and other means of grace, till Chriſt who is the morning ſtarre, the day ſtarre in the morning of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſhall ariſe in the hearts of his elect ones after a more glorious manner than when they were in this body of fleſh, in this world, which is rather a ſtate of darkneſs than of the light, in compariſon of that light of knowledge, of joy, and of comfort, which ſhall be to the Saints in heaven. To explain the words. The Apoſtle having before in the foregoing words declared the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the doctrine of the Goſpel, both from his own experience, and from the teſtimony of God the Father; now in theſe words he confirms the certainty of it from the conſent of the Prophets under the old Teſtament. As if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould have ſaid, The Doctrine of the Goſpel is confirmed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, therefore the Doctrine of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115586:181"/>the Goſpel is moſt true and certain, therefore if ye miſtruſt me in commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpelunto you, I remit you unto the Prophets of old, whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are a more ſurer word than this teſtimony of mine in reſpect of your ſelves as yet, unto which word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie you do well to attend, as a light which ſhineth in a dark place; as to that light which now under the ſtate of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converſion and of blindneſs may do you ſome good, till the vail is taken off from your hearts; and Chriſt the morning ſtarre whom you ſo much deſpiſed ariſe upon you by his bleſſed Spirit to unfold this word of propheſie unto you, which will then not be a light in a dark place, but a true light unto you indeed, Chriſt by his Spirit having unvaild your hearts, that you may ſee that was the Meſſiah of the world, that was the true Chriſt, whom you have crucified; and of which this more ſure word of Propheſie, or all the Prophets have ſpoken of. How this interpretation and explanation of the words may take with many, I cannot tell, but as yet, till God ſhall give in a further light upon my ſoul, I think it moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the minde of the Spirit. <hi>Aretius,

But alas, there is no more time, there are no more ſeaſons of grace afforded me; God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from me in reſpect of any future mery for ever, hell hath ſhut her mouth upon me; and therefore, O that I had to my everlaſting comfort complyed and hearkened to the voice of the ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with me; That I had walked up to the light of the ſpirit, then it had been otherwiſe with me to my perpetual joy, then it is now to my eternal miſery? Thus the wretched ſinner laments it ſelf when it is too late, and wiſhes it had never been

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God judgeth every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. For as many as have ſinned without Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law, and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law, that is, thoſe that are without the moral Law written upon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, but have onely the Law of nature written upon their hearts (though the moral Law is nothing but what is founded upon nature as appears in the 15. verſe. For the Gentiles which have not the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> the moral Law do by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the things contained in the Law) if they ſin againſt the Law written in their conſciences, ſhall onely be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Law; and thoſe that have the moral Law ſhall be judged according to the moral Law; but thoſe who have the light of the Goſpel, ſhall be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the light of the Goſpel, 16. v. In the day when God ſhal judge the ſecrets of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115586:192"/>mens hearts according to my Goſpel; And thoſe that have ſinned againſt the light of conviction, and the ſtrivings of the ſpirit ſhall be judged according to that light, and according as our light is, ſo will be our condemnation,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.22.</note> 
                  <hi>It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement then for us</hi> who live under the light of the Goſpel, and the ſpirits convictions, becauſe our light is the greater. And for thoſe who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Goſpel light, it will be more toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for thoſe at the day of judgement who have lived under a powerful Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all their dayes, and have had more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the ſpirit upon their hearts, and have had the ſpiritual Manna continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally falling round about their houſes, as the inhabitants of the famous City of <hi>London</hi> have who are bleſſed above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations with ſpiritual bleſſings, then thoſe who are leſs watred with ſhowers of Grace from heaven, if they ſhall let ſlip their opportunities, and ſleep out the day of viſitation which is afforded them. The Lord takes notice of every Sermon we hear, and of every prayer we have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of every time we have received the Sacrament, of every impreſſion we have
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115586:193"/>had upon our ſpirits, of all thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, exhortations, admonitions, reproofs, corrections, inſtructions we have had; of all that naturall knowledge we had, with the improvements of it, of all the prayers and beſeechings others have made, and put to God for us; of all thoſe ſecret checks of conſcience, of all thoſe various acts of providence in the courſe of our lives; marvellous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances from dangers, from ſickneſſes, from impriſonments; in providing for us when all other helps and means have failed; of all thoſe reſolutions we have made of better obedience, upon ſome notable conviction upon our ſpirits; of all our ſervices performed unto him in private and in publick; and of all that conference and communion we have had with the Saints; of all that progreſs we have towards heaven, and that if we had gone but a ſtep or two further we might have been happy; and according to the ſeverall gradations of our, ſpirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages upon the neglect of them, ſo ſhall our condemnation be. God will judge us for every Sermon, wherein we have not met him in a Sermon, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer wherein we have not met him
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115586:193"/>in a prayer, for every receiving of the Sacrament wherein we have not met Chriſt in that Sacrament. We are then ſaid to meet God in a duty, when upon the right improvement of it, God comes nigher to us in waies of further diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon our hearts, or our hearts are drawn nigher to God and to Jeſus Chriſt in way of heavenly mindedneſs, and ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ought to walk up to that light which we have, becauſe God hath to this end given this light unto us, that our evil deeds being made manifeſt, we may loath our ſelves for them, and avoid them for the time to come. Wicked men they hate the light,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe their deeds are evil;</hi> they know that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of light to make manifeſt; and thereupon if they ſhould come to the light, their conſciences would be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the peace of their beſotted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits lul'd aſleep in groſs ignorance, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecurity, the pleaſures of ſinne, and by the devil would be diſturbed. But the godly on the other ſide, they rejoyce in the light, in the light of the Word, in the light of the Spirit; and bleſs God for the time that ever they were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115586:194"/>with the evil nature of their ſinnes, and with the experience of Gods infinite goodneſs unto them in Jeſus Chriſt. A righteous man fears not the terrours of the Law;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.9</note> for <hi>the Law was not made for him, but for the rebellious, diſobedient, murtherers of fathers, and murtherers of mothers:</hi> And he rejoyceth in the glad tidings of the Spirit: He deſires to be taught by the Spirit, and daily to be nurtured up in the School of Chriſt, till he ſhall come to the perfection of the Saints in glory. <hi>He that doth truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wronght in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe if a mans ſpirit gives him in, that ſuch a thing is a duty, though it be nor, or ſuch a thing is a ſinne, though in it ſelf it be not a ſinne, yet if he walk not up according to that verdict his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience gives in of it, unleſs the Word of God ſpeaks directly againſt it, and it be directly oppoſite to the analogy and proportion of faith, he ſinnes in not ſo doing. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of faith is ſinne;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> that is, whatſoever we do doubtingly and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly, being in diſtruſt whether the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115586:194"/>thing ought to be done or no, if we do it, we ſinne in ſo doing. We ſhould do nothing but what we verily believe ought to be done. In theſe two caſes we may follow the light of our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In things indifferent, which are neither ſimply commanded, nor ſimply for bidden.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In things which do not poſitively contradict the doctrine of faith and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the expreſs Word of God; or a direct and an immediate conſequence, plain to the capacity of all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men void of any prejudice againſt the truth, drawn from ſolid and evident places of Scripture pat to the purpoſe we have in hand. But if any man ſhall pretend a Tenet, or a Cuſtom, or a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be received, believed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and practiſed, becauſe his own conſcience gives him in it is ſo, or ought to be believed and practiſed, though he hath an expreſs command to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Gods Word, I ſay that this mans heart is full of Atheiſm and unbelief, and groſly deluded by the devil, and though his erroneous conſcience gives him in, it muſt be ſo, yet he ſinnes if he
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115586:195"/>doth it, becauſe it is directly contrary to the Word of God. Now if a man ſinnes, if he walks not up to the light of his conſcience in ſome caſes, though it may be erroneous; then much more he walks not up to the light of the Word and of the Spirit, theſe are infallible lights without the leaſt errour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Lord God we beſeech thee, that ſeeing our hearts are ſo apt to deceive us, and to be deceived; the world to flatter us, and the devil to beguile us; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we live in unſtable times, full of deluſions, wherein the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity begins to work, and Satans agents are now transformed into Angels of light, that our hearts might not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with theſe meer phantaſmes, and ghoſts of piety, with theſe ſhadows in ſtead of ſubſtance, but give us that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye-ſalve, whereby we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the cunning ſleights of men who lye in wait to deceive; and that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prudence to foreſee the evils that are coming upon the earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3. Send forth thy light and thy truth, we beſeech thee, thy light is a true light, and thy truth is light, that by thy light we may ſee light, and by the teachings of thy
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115586:195"/>Spirit upon our hearts, we may be ſo eſtabliſhed in the waies of God, that neither the Errours, Hereſies, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies that are abroad in the world may taint us, nor that deſolation which is coming upon us for our ſinnes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be waſhed away with the tears of repentance, and with amendment of life, may drive us from our hope and confidence of God, but that patiently enduring the chaſtening of the Lord, becauſe we have ſinned againſt him, by that witneſſing act of thy Spirit, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaching us that we are thy children; in the midſt of all theſe heart-quaking times we may rejoyce in the expectation of future happineſs.</p>
